[Acts 16:9–15](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=140452872) & [John 14:23-29](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=140452911)

In the past couple of weeks, I’ve preached on how the apostolic church began to reach beyond the confines of the Jewish community to Gentiles. The first sermon was on the power of God’s love, how that power refuses to be confined by any force, whether it be death or social customs. God’s love will go wherever and to whomever it pleases. Last week, we talked about difference. It is sometimes very difficult to balance a warm acceptance of all people, no matter how different, with the understandable need of communities to have a coherent identity.

This week, I want to hit the subject of outreach once more, this time from a different angle.

As someone says, this morning’s lesson from Acts is an evangelist’s dream come true. What could be better than someone waving their arms and calling out, “Hey, over here! We want to be Christians, please!” That makes life easy.

It is important, therefore, to put this passage in some context. We hear just before today’s lesson that Paul and his companions want to go to [Asia](http://www.unrv.com/provinces/asia-minor.php), but they are “forbidden” to do so by the Holy Spirit. Then they try to go to [Bithynia](http://www.unrv.com/provinces/bithynia.php), but the Spirit doesn’t want that either. So they land in [Troas](http://www.luthersem.edu/ckoester/paul/journey2/Troas.htm), where Paul has a dream calling them to Macedonia. Then and only then do they encounter [Lydia](http://n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia) and other people waiting for them to bring the gospel.

There are a couple of ways to take all of this. The first is to say, as some of my colleagues do, “practice makes perfect.” Paul had to try multiple paths—and have those paths smacked down by God—before he found something that worked. So God blesses the faithfulness of the apostles trying again and again.

But another way to see this, as one commentator does, is to say that we ought not get hung up on finding one Big Thing to do for outreach. There may not be a single program or technique or style of worship that brings people into the church. Instead she suggests that churches have to listen keenly to people’s needs, specifically their need for the good news of Jesus Christ. You have to find a way to relate to people and work from where they are, rather than depend on a one-size-fits-all approach.

That makes good sense to me. If we want to grow as a church, we’re going to have to learn how to listen to the people outside our community. Not that we don’t already, but we will need to learn how to listen *intentionally*, with an ear to how we can help them encounter the power of God’s love for themselves.

That’s not always easy to do. For one thing, it requires us to be a lot more active than we’re accustomed to being. For example, it’s no secret that we’re missing the twenty-somethings in this church. Dunno what happened to them, but by and large, they’re not here. If we want to bring those people into the church—and I think we do—we might have to do something crazy like, oh, say, sit down and talk to a few of them. What do you need from a church? What do you need from Jesus? Asking such questions takes some commitment from us.

Then too, we need to know what we need. I don’t mean that in the simplistic sense that you have to meet your own needs before you can meet someone else’s, but in the sense that you have to know what your own needs are before you can understand somebody else’s, let alone keep the two straight. As Jen can tell you, that’s one of the reason counselors go to therapy before they try to help somebody else: you have to know what stuff belongs to you, and what stuff belongs to the person you’re talking to.

There’s bad news and good news on that score. (Actually, bad news and good news and gooder news.) The bad news is that many if not most of us are fairly reluctant to take our own stuff out and look at it. We too need God, but it is both painful and challenging to admit that. God has this way of rattling our cages when we least expect it, of forcing us to change and grow and make ourselves vulnerable. We don’t like that, and since we live in a society that tells us that we don’t have to put up with it, we don’t. If it doesn’t feel good, we find another church that doesn’t upset us so much, or we simply drop out altogether and seldom, if ever, think of God again.

But if we are honest with ourselves, we will understand that we too need Jesus’ peace. That’s the good news: because we all need some variation on the same thing, once we tune in, it’s not that difficult to figure out. What do you need to feel the peace of Christ in your heart? For a client of the Kewaskum Community Pantry, it might be that they need the security of a bag of groceries before they can feel it. Some of us might need to learn how to be more grateful in our lives, or how better to communicate with our husband or wife, before Christ’s peace really begins to sink in. Now, obviously not everything is equal here. I don’t care how much you tell me you need a Mercedes-Benz to feel Jesus’ peace in your heart, it’s just not true. But many of us struggle with the reality of our hunger, our brokenness, our incompleteness, and yes, our sinfulness. We don’t always know that we need God, but we know that we need something. So part of our Christian journey is to surface those realities and come to understand how we need God. Again, that’s a lot of work. Not everybody’s up for it.

Let me give you an example of what I mean. You may have heard this story before—I just told it to Abigail the other day. There was a time in my mid-20’s when I felt utterly and completely lost. I had trouble finding a job, trouble keeping a girlfriend. Not coincidentally, I was drinking a lot and depressed most of the time. I was lost and I felt like a loser.

I was on the verge of moving from Minneapolis to Washington D.C. to start over, but as it happened, my roommate attended a UCC congregation of which he had spoken very highly. Before I left, I thought I would go to church with him, both as a way of saying “thank you” for his friendship, and to see this place that was so obviously important to him.

So I went, and worship was pretty good. But after church was when the real experience began. It took me half an hour to make it from our pew to the back door. I was mobbed by friends of my roommate who kept coming up to me saying “Good to meet you, we’ve heard so much about you, we’d love to have you back sometime.” I said, well, I’m getting ready to move, and they said with utmost sincerity, “Then the next time you’re in town, come and see us again. We’d love to have you.” I walked out of the sanctuary dizzy.

This was more than just a bunch of people who thought they were supposed to act nice. This was a warm and authentic welcome of someone who didn’t feel very much like he had a home in the world. Their act of hospitality, I understood, was inspired. It was the work of God through them. That realization propelled me not just into faith, but off to seminary, which led me into ministry, which led me here. Arguably everything I have—my marriage, my career, my children—comes from that one Sunday morning and a handful of people who chose not to sleep in. It took a lot of work to develop from that starting point, but that’s where it all began.

To the point, I didn’t know that I needed God’s community until that point. It wasn’t until I was completed that I understood that something was missing. Once I found that peace that I was lacking—and put a lot of time and effort into understanding and extending it—I was able to pass it on to someone else.

And there is the gooder news I was talking about. We all need Christ’s peace in our hearts, we all need that home in the world, what someone called “Grandma’s house” the other night, and God is constantly at work to get it to us, *through us*. We are not alone in the world; the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, is here with us to teach us and guide us and remind us of what Christ taught us. It is there to comfort us, to calm our anxious hearts, to ease our fears and to send out into the world to those who call out, “Come and help us.”

When we reach out to those people, those other lost souls, we begin to redeem ourselves from the very same fears that keep us imprisoned. We become both Lydia *and* Paul. More: we take part in the work of God as our outreach becomes in-reach at the same time.

We are healed and welcomed as we heal and welcome others. We find the peace of God by giving it to others. When Christ says, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you,” what he means is: I leave it in your community, and I give it to you through that community. You have heard it [said](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=140453515),

> Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it.

but I say to you that those who welcome the lost out of their own need for peace, and even more those who go out in search of them, are liable to find themselves angels without even knowing it. You all, we, are capable of finding and offering that peace, and for that, let us give God our thanks and praise. Amen.
