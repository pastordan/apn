[Exodus 2:23-3:14](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=145609509)

Last week, we kicked off our series on Exodus by talking about the term “redemption.” If you will recall, to redeem something means to buy it back. To redeem someone means to buy them out of slavery.

I want to start this morning by defining two more terms for you, a term and a name, actually. The first of those is “ferhoodle,” a word you may have heard me use from time to time. It’s a good Pennsylvania Dutch word meaning all mixed up or discombobulated. So you can say “don’t ferhoodle the drawer while you’re looking for a pen,” or as I want to tell you, “it’s been a long week, and I’m all ferhoodle this morning.” I am and it has been. We had the Chicken Dinner on Wednesday, of course, which seriously ferhoodles everything. We also had a cleanup session on Friday, which went really well but took a lot of energy. If those weren’t enough, I have to tell you that Abigail went back into the hospital at 1:00 on Monday morning.

So I am ferhoodle. If this sermon makes less sense than usual, you will know why.

Enough of that. Let’s talk about the name. As Terence Freitheim says, we learn quite a bit about Moses and about God in this passage. One of the most remarkable things we learn is God’s name, more or less.

Now, this gets complicated, so bear with me. First of all, notice that Moses doesn’t ask God how he should introduce himself to the Egyptians, but to the *Israelites*. They apparently don’t know him very well, if at all, and he feels the need to know who he should say he is representing.

So he asks, and God gives this weird answer: “I am who I am,” he says. It’s actually the future tense of the verb *to be*, so it can be translated in various ways: I am who I am, I will be who I will be, I am who I will be, or I will be whom I am, I will cause to be what I will cause to be, and so on. It’s really open-ended in the English and the Hebrew, which is the point. This is a hidden God, one who is not going to let himself be defined by somebody else.

“I am who I am” doesn’t sound much like a name in English, and it doesn’t in the Hebrew, either. But “I am” in Hebrew has four letters: יהוה or YHWH. Here’s where it gets really complicated. Hebrew doesn’t really have vowels. It has consonants, which you see here, and then “points” to indicate what vowel sounds go in between. So depending on how you point these four letters, you get Yahweh or Yehovah.

As if that weren’t ferhoodle enough, there’s a tradition in Judaism that you don’t say God’s name. So the scribes who put together the Hebrew scriptures started to use the vowels from the similar word Adonai, or “Lord.” By custom, that’s written in all capital letters. So whenever you see LORD or Lord in the Bible, you know that it’s translating that word יהוה.

The whole exchange between Moses and God is remarkable. You don’t just go around asking God what his proper name is. So we know that Moses has a lot of nerve, which will come in handy when he speaks to Pharaoh. And God not only tolerates Moses’ question, he welcomes it. As Freitheim says, “God reveals himself not simply at divine initiative, but in interaction with a questioning human party.”

God is happy to stay hidden, until Moses asks who he is. Then he reveals something of himself. Don’t be afraid to ask questions of God, then.

The other thing that we should notice here is how Moses objects to God’s plan for him, how he resists it. It starts with Moses’ first question to God: “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” Again and again, he will put up some reason not to cooperate with God, and God will patiently reassure him again and again. This goes on for four chapters, until Moses finally runs out of reasons not to do what God asks of him, and only then does he take on the mission. God doesn’t always like this—in fact, he gets angry after a while—but he puts up with it.

God seems to need Moses, to need his leadership and initiative, to accomplish the mission. God enters into relationship with Moses—a very intimate and sometimes difficult relationship—and sticks with it. He takes a chance on Moses, even lets him take the lead in running the Exodus. This is not a god who says “you do this, you do that” or just does it himself. God works through the fragility and weakness of ordinary humans.

God also waits until the time is right to act. When the Israelites “groan” and “cry out” to God, he turns his full attention to them. He “hears,” “remembers,” and “sees” them, and “knows” their suffering. The English translation doesn’t do justice to the original language here. “Cry out” is what you do when you’re morally outraged, or pleading your case to a judge. “Remembered” means something like “paid mind to” or “focused upon.” God hasn’t forgotten the covenant with Israel, and he hasn’t delayed acting on their behalf. But now that the fullness of time has arrived, he’s putting all his attention on it. In the same way, “looked upon” is more than just seeing: it means to move toward, or to face someone with kindness or sympathy. When we say “the Lord look upon you with kindness and grant you peace,” that’s the same word. And last, when God “takes notice” of the Israelites, it means he cares about them, has compassion for them. In other words, he feels their suffering himself. He suffers alongside them. That is a strange thing for a god to do at this time.

A couple of “this and that” things to mention: “Horeb” means “wasteland” in Hebrew, which ought to disappoint the people of Mt. Horeb, down in Southwest Wisconsin. Moses is out that way tending sheep, which is about the most mundane job you could have at the time, but it’s also the quintessential job for Israelite leaders. “Bush” in Hebrew is *seneh*, or “Sinai.” According to Deuteronomy and the book of Judges, that’s where God is originally from. It’s strange to think of God having a hometown, but there it is. And really, the last thing is the bit about Moses taking off his sandals because he was standing on “holy ground.” What makes it holy is not the land itself. It’s just an ordinary spot. But God is there, and it is his presence that makes it holy. The right way to understand that is as Hosea and Isaiah say: “God is the holy one in your midst.” God chooses to be among his people, and that makes for holy ground. Otherwise, it’s just a bush in the middle of a wasteland.

I mention that in part to show how God is present to us in the most mundane parts of our lives all the way up to the most profound. Like I said, we had this cleanup day on Friday, part of a larger effort to work on things around the property. We have a little more cleaning up to do, and then our next project will probably be the overgrown “flowerbed” by the Parish Hall. Eventually, we’re going to spruce up the hall itself, and yes, we’ll talk about updating—very gently—our sanctuary. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

It seems silly to say that God was with us on Friday as we cleared out stuff from the basement, the kitchen, from under the balcony stairs and the schoolhouse, but I think he was. I also get the sense, as silly as it might seem at first, that God is challenging us to see how our building is holy ground, how it proclaims that the Lord, the holy one, is in our midst. How can we feel like we are in God’s presence when we come to church? How can our kids feel like they are in God’s presence? How can strangers who come to visit our sanctuary feel like they are entering into God’s presence? I think God wants us to start asking ourselves those kinds of questions, and answering them prayerfully. I think God is ready to show us more of himself in response to our questions, and ready to enter into deeper relationship with us through, yes, our building and grounds.

That might seem like a lightweight point. But let me ask you this: if you were all ferhoodle—if you were all mixed up and tangled up and sad and upset and tired—if you had a kid in the hospital, or a husband or a wife—wouldn’t you like to go someplace filled with peace? Wouldn’t you like to go somewhere you could sit still and be with God? Wouldn’t you like to go somewhere you could cry out and enter into relationship with the Lord, where you could feel him at work to free you and buy you back from whatever slavery you were in? Wouldn’t you like someplace where you can feel yourself getting sorted out and untangled and made sense of again?

Sure you would. Place matters. It matters because in the midst of our daily lives, God chooses to be with us, to enter into relationship with us, to feel our pain and our suffering, to give it his full attention and to lead us out of it. He does that here, in our simple, everyday place. He hears us, he sees us, he remembers us, and he knows us. And so that simple, everyday place, where we do our simple, everyday stuff suddenly becomes holy ground, where extraordinary things begin to happen. I’m not going to tell you that you have to take your shoes off every time you come in here, but I will suggest that perhaps we might want to find some way of showing that something remarkable is happening here. Amen.
