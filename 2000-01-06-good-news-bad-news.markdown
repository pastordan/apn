“It sounds to me like what you really want to do is be a writer,” said Jen, my old friend and new fiancée.

 My skin flushed, my muscles tightened—a classic response to sudden stress. But I knew when I was beat. She’d lined up the crosshairs on her Counselor’s Insight .30-.06 and nailed me right between the eyes. Plunk. Another unconfessed struggle drops to the ground and gamely awaits its ear tag. Like most targets, I hadn’t even known the season was open yet.

 I’d been spending the week quietly, reading up on evangelism for the Penn Central Conference ministry team I was named to last fall. Well, at least I hadn’t been making a lot of noise—in truth, the reading was pretty disturbing. Everybody who writes on evangelism, at least in the UCC, seems to think that they’ve got it right, and everybody else is wrong. The evangelicals want us to go around telling whoever will listen about our personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and curse the contemporary lack of resolve for witness in Christianity. The ecumenical Christians either try to show how they’re really secretly evangelicals, or to come up with clever new formulations for how teaching, worship and service are really forms of evangelism. Some people argue that evangelism is really just church growth, and that if we would only position ourselves to be as welcoming as possible, we could win many souls for Christ. Others reject this idea, and stress that you must lead with your faith, and let all functions follow the strength of your convictions. Precious few believe that evangelism is not an invitation for outsiders to join our inside band, but for us to leave our comfort behind and join those outsiders as equals, not as chosen people endowed with some magical “fix-it” of hope, love, and obedience. Now see, I’m doing it. The point is that for such rewarding field of endeavor, there seems to be little joy, and much anger. Or is that just my denomination? Mennonites, Methodists? Presbyterians? Anyone care to respond?

I’ll brood on evangelism another day. Getting back to the original point of the story, as I worked through this material, I shared some of my frustration with Jen. The material is outdated, I complained, and it works off outmoded assumptions and worldviews. That point of view has eased somewhat as I moved into some material more to my liking, but still, as I told Jen last night, I have this feeling that if I want to find writing on evangelism that I can truly embrace, I’m going to have to go out and write it myself.

 Arrogant? You bet. I don’t know enough about this field to suggest that we overturn the applecart, but the more I read, the more I’m convinced that we need a new vocabulary for talking about our faith, because the old one simply doesn’t work any longer. Furthermore, the more I read, the more convinced I become that the reason we protestants spend so much time arguing about how and why to do evangelism is that we have not caught up to the paradigm shift going on around us. We’re fighting over the arrangement of deck chairs on the Titanic, to borrow an old joke. Which is not to say that we should waste a lot of time on regret. No one has mastered the New Paradigm, sometimes referred to as Postmodernism or the Millennial Outlook. The ground is unstable and full of sinkholes wherein reside the remains of philosophies like so many abandoned Volkswagens. The “Believer’s Churches”—the Mennonites, the Brethren, the Churches of God, Pentecostals, Baptists—are doing better than the rest only insomuch as their system allows for a bit more flexibility. The fastest-growing church may be No Church.

 Ordinarily, I make a point of staying out of paradigm shifts. Too messy, and I never did like problems of perspective. But my core conviction is that God is trying to speak to us in a new way, and until we figure out how to interpret that speech, our churches will be firmly stuck in neutral. Oh, my congregation might grow, and so might yours, but where’s the UCC going to go in the next twenty or thirty years? Where will any of our denominations go? What will happen to the church universal most of us claim to appreciate so much? I include here even the branches of Judaism, which are beginning to look at methods of evangelism, however low-key, for the first time in 2,000 years. This is in response to a marked decline in active participation, a problem they share with most Christian denominations, and mixed marriages, which afflicts only the Catholics.

But I wander again. My point is (or was) that we need a new way to talk about our faith in the Post-Christendom era. It’s nice to say that Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior of my life, but do you know what that means exactly? I don’t.

 So here’s the bad news: given my writing skills, and my generally lusty approach to words, paragraphs and punctuation, I think I’m at least one of the people who needs to start writing us toward a new vocabulary of faith. If God is speaking to us in a new way, then I feel called to be one of the ones listening and taking notes. Perhaps that is not so much bad news as the way good news troubles the waters of those who hear it.

It does trouble my waters. As Jen suggested to me on the phone last night, once you hear the call, you need to respond to it. (I think the way she put it was that if I intended never to take a chance during our marriage, she’d give me back the ring now and spare me the cost of divorce. But I knew what she meant.) And responding to a call means making some difficult choices.

I have always wanted to be a writer, and have done everything I could to avoid fulfilling my dream. I wanted to be an academic, I wanted to be a cab driver, I wanted to be a drunk, I wanted to be a pastor. Anything but being a writer. Too scary, too shameful. I’m afraid that I won’t have anything to say, that I’ll be blocked so firmly that nothing will ever roll off my fingertips. Slightly better, I’m afraid that I’ll write many fine and roundly ignored books. I’m afraid that the money won’t come in, that I won’t be able to support myself. I’m ashamed to think about leaving the parish, embarrassed to know that I wouldn’t be going into the office every day. Can I really be worth anything if all I do is sit around and read and write all day? I’m not even married, and I have to talk to my future wife about supporting my creative ass. I hate it. Despite all these worries, God keeps coming back and asking for me to put my keyboard in the service of the Holy Spirit. Yeek. What do I do now?

Answer the call, that’s what. Which is where the difficult decisions come in. I’d like to be able to say that all I need to do is carve out more time in my present position for writing, but that’s not realistic. A church this size and with these issues deserves someone who can give them full attention. Don’t get me wrong—I’m not saying I’m leaving, or that I can’t continue here—I’m just saying that the needs of a congregation such as Faith Church and my need to write are in the long run incompatible. The question is, how do I get myself to something, or somewhere, that is compatible, without neglecting or harming my writing, my congregation, or myself? I want to give full measure to each of them, and it’s well-nigh impossible.

Put another way, how do I respond with integrity to my legitimate call to pastoral ministry and my legitimate call to the ministry of the written word? Jen told me that she can see a difference in me when I am in front of the congregation, can see that my caring for them comes through in worship. She didn’t think it would be appropriate for me to simply give up on being a pastor, and I had to agree. Without service, particularly worship and pastoral care, I’m not much of a person, let alone a writer. I feel incomplete, adrift—lost again, in a word. But the more I write, the more I want to write. Without time to read, reflect, and create, I am not much of a pastor, either. I get crabby, impatient. Well, okay, I become more crabby, more impatient. The point is that I can’t do the one without the other, and they can each be all-consuming. How to avoid being eaten alive by my own ambition, then?

The long-term answer seems pretty clear: I’ll have to find some part-time ministry, perhaps a chaplaincy or a small church that isn’t interested in much in the way of growth, and then hunker down for some serious writing in the extra space that opens up. The trick will be finding some position that is enough to stimulate me, but not so much as to overload me and prevent me from writing.

With a little finesse and a little luck, that can be accomplished. What has me more worried is the short-term. What does this newly uncovered sense of call to writing say about my present call to Faith Church? I don’t think it was a mistake to come here, by any means, and I’m certainly not bagging the call. I guess I do have to revisit (privately) what this means for the length of my stay. Could it mean that I am only intended to put the place back on track, then saddle up and ride off into the sunset? Could be. Could it mean that I am meant to stay here for a good long while, and cram in time to write by hook or by crook? Could be. Dang this God of ours, anyway—always telling us that we’ve got a call, but waiting until later to explain exactly what that means. And here I thought I’d have a nice quiet week reading about evangelism… Well, anyway, when I know what it all means, you all will be the first I’ll pass it on to.
