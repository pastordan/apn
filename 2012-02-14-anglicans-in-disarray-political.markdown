I’d like to snark at a story like [this one](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/10/anglican-mission-in-the-americas-rwanada_n_1266831.html) about conservative Anglicans running into trouble with the Rwandan bishops who gave their schismatic blood-lust an ecclesiastical fig-leaf. Serves them right. But I know these troubles lead to stories like [this one](http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2012/02/13/dioceses-of-quincy-chicago-meet-to-discuss-possible-future-together/), which is sad.

And it all leads to stories like [this one](http://www.episcopalcafe.com/lead/episcopal_church/what_is_wrong_with_the_episcop.html):

> What is wrong with The Episcopal Church?This is not a rhetorical question. Conversations about how to “fix” the church are raging all over the place. But it isn’t clear that we agree on what is wrong with it. One can even argue that nothing is wrong, and the decline in church membership is symptomatic of cultural forces beyond our control. What is your diagnosis?

> My sense is that we have are not doing a good enough job in congregational development and evangelism to attract and inspire people. I am aware that there are any number of presuppositions and begged questions in that brief statement, but I toss it out just to get the ball rolling.

> I think this is an important conversation to have, because if we can’t agree on a diagnosis, we certainly won’t agree on a prescription.

I may take a stab at that question tomorrow.
