I was about to set off in a brave new direction this week when that duck got me pinned down. I have so much mail on his behalf that I feel obliged to clear the decks, as it were, and dispose of him before I move on to other, greener pastures. Or at least fields more theological than avian.

Before we dive into the mailbag, however, there is one small point of business to attend to. On the suggestion of at least one reader, I have attached this week’s column in Microsoft Word format. Hopefully, that’ll make it easier to read. I also suggest that if it’s difficult for you to read on-line, print the column out and read it in hard copy. The idea is to give you something to read, not just another long-winded, short-brained e-mail to skim perfunctorily before hitting the “delete” button. Savor this stuff, dammit, or I’ll be forced to start insulting you at the bottom of the page.

Well, now that I’ve worked my crankiness out, let’s look at the responses to last week’s column. About half of them were along the lines of “you’re stuck with a duck,” or “you were meant to have it.” But some few went into more detail. One set of readers offered me advice on parenting:  
It would be best to take Duck to Long’s Park to let him (or her, did you check the sex of said duck yet?) go cruising for the opposite sex. This is an important stage of a duck’s life.

I have to confess that I wouldn’t be able to sex a duck if my life depended on it—and believe me, some days I think it does—but the dating advice seems basically sound. The more I look at the duck, the more it seems like a distressed, alienated teenaged kind of duck. Perhaps landing in my ivy patch was a call for help? I’ll have to stop by the pet store on the way home for some duck zit cream and parenting manuals.

Another friend wrote back with this advice:

> RE the duck (with a nod to the Politically Correct Bedtime Stories I am currently reading!): I think your responsibility in this age of empowerment is to help the duck to access its own sense of authority and purpose, such that it is able to find its own sense of “home.” Then, when it feels ready, it will waddle itself off to follow its calling. Remember the words of Lao Tzu: “to lead the people, walk behind them.” However, remember never to fall into a co-dependent relationship with your fowl friend. Do not encourage it to fall into dependency on you!

I hope this friend won’t be too insulted when I say that she is, not surprisingly, a minister in the United Church of Christ. You can draw your own conclusions about that, but again, the advice is sound. The only sticking point to it is that a ceramic duck is not very responsive to empowerment therapy. For that matter, it doesn’t really respond to any kind of pastoral intervention. Mostly it just sits there like the piece of statuary it is, casting a humorous gaze at me with its beady, contemptuous eye. “Go ahead, enable me,” it seems to be saying, “make me independent, fool.” And then it begins to quack maniacally. I’ve been in a caregiving profession for too long, or I’ve been thinking too much about the duck, one or the other.

In any case, perhaps my favorite response to the duck dilemma comes from a friend in Chicago. She asks:

> How heavy is this duck? How old does it seem?
> 
> If it is rather heavy, it couldn’t have come from far away.
> 
> If it is old, it could belong to an old lady who can barely walk through her backyard…she must miss it dearly (as the good Catholic that I am, guilt has always plagued me and that surround me).
> 
> The problem is, how do you go about your neighborhood asking for the rightful owner without looking like a strange desperate psychomaniac[?] How can this de-sensitized world that we live in care for the reunion of a ceramic duck with its rightful owner?
> 
> In any case, you might as well make the duck’s stay as comfortable and enjoyable for both of you as possible. I have a neighbor that dresses up her lawn duck in [H]awaiian clothes. You could do a variant, according to your personal taste. I think you could make a good lawn ornament duck owner.

This response has all the characteristics I look for in good writing. It’s by turns, thoughtful, imaginative, neurotic, compassionate, theological. Best of all, it involves ducks. It also includes a little compliment for me at the end, but what of it? It’s an unsolicited testimonial, and who’s to say that I wouldn’t make a good duck owner?

  In all seriousness, this friend asks a good question, which only involves ducks tangentially. How is it, she wants to know, that one deals with the absurdity of life honestly and ethically, without seeming like a complete goober? How do you live as a saint when you’re dying as a geek? For a guy who long ago committed himself to a ministry to the awkward, it’s a fair question, and I look forward to hearing your responses. In the meantime, don’t touch that dial! We’ll be back next week with more gripping duck theology!
