[Exodus 32:1-14](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=149781423)

So: Moses has been up on the mountain with the Lord for forty days, and the Israelites are starting to get impatient with the lack of leadership. So they go to Aaron, Moses’ brother and deputy, and say to him, “give us new leaders.” They justify this request based on their claim not to know what has become of “this man Moses,” as if they barely knew him. Aaron is agreeable. “Give me all your gold,” he says, and presto-change-o! they have the golden calf overnight. Then he tells them it’s party time, which they’re all too happy to do. We are told that they “indulge in revelry,” which has a negative, selfish connotation to it.

It’s not entirely clear here what the golden calf is meant to represent. We commonly think of it as a new god, that is, a replacement for the Lord. But that same word “gods” can also refer to judges, rulers, or angels. So it’s possible that the calf is a replacement not for the Lord, but *Moses*. That is to say, up until this point, Moses has been God’s representative for the Israelites. In his absence, they want somebody new to be the Lord’s messenger, and they think they can get that by building themselves an idol. This makes sense of some things, such as why Aaron declares the day to be a festival to the Lord. Presumably the Israelites wouldn’t celebrate the very God they’d just overthrown.

But here’s the problem. Moses is a living, breathing person who represents the living God. The Lord is restless and undomesticated and is not a *thing* — he is a person, and must be related to as such. No piece of metal that cannot see or hear or speak can cut it.

So whether the calf represents God or his messenger turns out to be a moot point. The dumb beast can’t do the job.

Then there’s the matter of the job they’re asking the calf to do. To get what’s wrong here, you have to understand how unusual the Lord is compared to the other gods in this time and place. Back then, gods had statues that represented them, and the statues lived in houses (temples) where you could catch up with them when you needed to see them. The relationship was *contractual*: the worshiper brought a sacrifice to the temple, and asked the god to do him or her a favor in return.

But the Lord isn’t like that at all. He can’t be represented by a statue, or any object. He doesn’t have a house. He doesn’t even have a proper name, as we have seen. He most certainly cannot be bought off with burnt offerings. He is wild and free and wants his people to do right by one another, instead of giving him burnt offerings. “I desire mercy, not sacrifice,” as Jesus says in Matthew 9:13.

The Lord, in other words, wants a *covenantal* relationship with his people, not a contractual relationship. That means, in the first place, that he wants to relate to his people as neighbors or as a family, not on the basis of what one can get from the other. Likewise, the Lord wants us to live in covenant with one another. We are to be to one another more than just the sum of our economic potential, more than just what we can get out of each other. We are to be neighbors to one another, brothers and sisters who care for and experience the entire person, not just those pieces that are to our advantage.

In the second place, however, a covenant is not simply a solemn contract. It is a promise from God to fulfill or not fulfill certain intentions, often leaving us in charge of exactly how that’s carried out. So when God says to Noah, “I will never again destroy the creation,” it’s Noah and his descendants who decide how that will play out. And when God tells Moses “I will lead the Israelites out of Egypt,” it is Moses (with the Lord’s assistance) who charts the course.

So a covenant is a promise into the fulfillment of which God leads us, but in which we have considerable freedom. “Here is what I am going to do for you,” says God, and we grow into the promise.

The calf fails on both counts. God has given the Israelites this new vocation of being neighbors to one another — really, a new identity as neighbors, rather than cogs in Pharaoh’s brick-making machine — and the first thing they do when they think nobody’s paying attention is chuck the idea of neighborliness and get back to what they’re familiar with, which is the contractual way of relating to one another. What can I squeeze out of this chump?

By tossing over Moses or God for the calf, the Israelites have rejected the promise of the covenant as well. They have said — not for the first or last time — that not only do they not think the Lord can lead them out of Egypt, but they don’t want to become the kind of people who could be redeemed. No thanks, we feel better about exploiting one another, even if it means being exploited ourselves.

Is it any wonder then that the Lord seems ready to pack the whole thing in?

Fortunately, Moses has a level head for once. He appeals to the Lord’s reasonableness — come on, you just led these people out of slavery! —- and to his reputation: do you really want to be known as the God who got this far and threw it all away? Then he reminds God of the promise he has made to make a great nation of Israel. As Terence Fretheim puts it, Moses has something important to say here, and say it he does. As a consequence, God changes his mind, and the Exodus continues.

It continues in our own day, I think, which is a good way to begin wrapping up this series. What the episode of the golden calf tells us is not so much that we are sinful, but that our sin comes in some particular ways. We are anxious and impatient when we perceive an absence of leadership. We feel that we need someone to stand before God in our place, because it is too awful to consider the alternative. But we criticize those who take our place before the Lord when they tell us things we don’t like to hear, and when they are gone, we are quick to rush back to familiar ways, even if we know they won’t work. We are all too happy not to be challenged to find new ways to be with one another, all too happy to decide that it is too difficult to become the people God has promised we can be.

We are quick to behave, in short, as if the Lord were no longer part of the equation. And if the Lord is no longer part of the equation, we must invent some kind of tool to take his place, even as we know it can’t possibly do the job.

Yet the Exodus still continues. God is still at work among us and between us to bring us out of slavery in all its many forms, and to make of us the people that he knows we can be. God, who is faithful to his promises, has not given up on the covenant. He continues to call us to move forward into the future and to assume the new identity of free people and neighbors and family to one another.

We continue to receive that promise here in the gathered community of the church. We receive the promise when we tell the stories about how we are together as a community in a way distinct from the world. We receive it when we hear scripture tell the story of how we are the people of God. We receive it when we come to God’s welcome table and take part in the Lord’s supper. We receive it when we tell the story of the living God who is at work in our midst to make all things new. All of these gifts confer upon us the identity of the Lord’s redeemed people. They point us toward a future that is very different from what would have happened otherwise because of God’s presence among us.

Though we are weak and often prone to stray from the covenant, yet God is always there to bring us back. God is still speaking, and thank God for that, because we are still in need of redeeming. We are still in need of learning how to be neighbors to one another, how to become the people God wants and knows we can be.

To that end, I want to close today with a prayer I came across the other day, a Welsh prayer used before communion. It doesn’t match the vocabulary of Exodus, but I think it speaks to our longing for redemption. It is, in that sense, the opposite of the “get-it-for-ourselves” spirit of the golden calf. Listen:

> Lord Jesus Christ,  
> you draw and welcome us,  
> emptied of pride and hungry for your grace,  
> to this your kingdom’s feast.  
> Nowhere can we find food for which our souls cry out,  
> but here, Lord, at your table.  
> Invigorate and nourish us, good Lord,  
> that in and through this bread and wine  
> your love may meet us  
> and your life complete us in the power and glory of your kingdom.

Amen.
