Bill had a pretty good day yesterday. He got to play outside after school, and just before dinner, we got a phone call inviting him to a sleepover tomorrow night. After dinner he and I filled up the tires on my bike, dusted it off, and took a ride down to Town Hall and back. (I wanted to ask a question of the board before their meeting that night.) As we parked our bikes, we spotted a black cat walking in the grass on a hillside behind the hall. When we came out, a second one had appeared closer to the door. He had obviously been through the wringer somehow: he had scabbed-over wounds on his rump, and one tooth stuck out from his mouth at a crazy angle, almost perpendicular to his jaw.

We named him “Fang,” of course.

Fang turned out to be friendly, so we spent a few minutes giving him pets before heading home. Bill made it all the way up the big hill before our house without having to get off his bike and walk it. *I* made it up the big hill!

When we got home, Bill got to polish off two cupcakes that had been sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. Like I said, a pretty good day.

But the best part of it was that his Milwaukee Brewers Kids’ Club package showed up in the mail. We had to set it aside until Mama and I decided if we wanted to hold it until his birthday at the end of next month.

We chose to let him open it today, and here’s the result: an ID tag, a necklace, a coin purse, a hat *and* a tote bag. Everything but actual tickets to the games, which Papa will have to buy before they all get snatched up.
