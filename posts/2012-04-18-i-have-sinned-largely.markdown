title: I have sinned largely

I’ve been doing a little research in ancient liturgy. It’s not as bad as it might sound at first. I sort of approach it as poetry, which makes it go down easier, and there’s some good stuff in there.

I’ve come to a few conclusions even from the little I’ve read so far:

1. It’s amazing how much continuity there is between ancient liturgy and contemporary. Some of that was recovered intentionally in Vatican II, but still. When you go to a Catholic mass today, you’re hearing more or less the same prayers Christians have been saying for 1400 years.
2. Holy crap, those people liked to pray that they wouldn’t get zapped by God for being offensive little toads daring to come before the Lord High God. There are oblations *everywhere.*
3. That being said, there really is some lovely stuff in there.

I was particularly taken today by this prayer of confession from the York Missal:

> **I know to God full of might,  
>    and to his mother Mary maiden bright,  
>    and to all souls here,  
>    and to the father ghostly,  
> I have sinned largely,  
>    in many serious sins,  
> In thought, in speech and in delight,  
>    in word, in work, I deserve to be punished,  
>    and worthy I am to blame,  
> Therefore I pray Saint Mary and all holy souls,  
>    here in God’s name,  
>    and the priest to pray for me,  
> That God have mercy and pity,  
>    for his manhood,  
>    of my wretched sinfulness,  
>    and give me grace and forgiveness  
>    of all my misdeeds.**

No, I have no idea what “for his manhood” means, either. Anyway, that’s what the people say. The priest gets off easy by comparison:

> I confess to God, Blessed Mary, and all His saints, and to you brethren that, sinner, I have sinned exceedingly in heart, in mouth, in things done, in things left undone, by my fault; wherefore I beseech Mary, the glorious mother of God, and all the saints of God, and you, to pray for me.

And so you should.
