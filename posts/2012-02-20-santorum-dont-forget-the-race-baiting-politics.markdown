Last night I blasted [Rick Santorum](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/18/10444177-santorum-obama-believes-in-phony-theology-not-based-on-bible) for these remarks:

> “It’s not about you. It’s not about you,” Santorum said at a Tea Party rally, directing his comments at the president. “It’s not about your quality of life. It’s not about your job. It’s about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology, but no less a theology.”

I went off on Santorum’s *religious* intolerance, and he does indeed seem to think he’s campaigning for Pope of America. But it seems pretty clear that his slap at “phony theology” was meant to call to mind Obama’s connection to Jeremiah Wright, whose adherence to black liberation theology has been roundly criticized as un-Christian. If you doubt me on that, google [“Jeremiah Wright phony theology”](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Jeremiah+Wright+phony+theology&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). You’ll see that the right-wing blogosphere has made the connection. Don’t do that on an empty stomach, though.

Santorum followed the boilerplate of conservative outrage by positing “values” as zero-sum game: *they’re* imposing *their* (phony) values at the expense of *our* values. That’s pretty standard. But then he came back to the implied comparison between the two theologies:

> Reporters followed up, asking if Santorum believes that makes him less of a Christian?
> 
> “No one’s suggesting that,” Santorum contended. “I’m suggesting that — a lot well obviously as we all know in the Christian church there are a lot of different stripes of Christianity, and so I’m just saying he’s imposing his values on the church and I think that’s wrong. … The president says he’s a Christian, he’s a Christian.”

Sure sure, there’s all kinds of Christians: there’s the real Christians and the phony ones, the ones who hold phony theologies like, oh, I don’t know, maybe that black people are in fact people? Or that women should have access to birth control as part of their health care benefits? There’s a coded racial attack in that all by itself; “benefits” and “abortion” are often used as proxies against the supposed entitlement of blacks and other minorities.

And did you catch that last bit? “The president says he’s a Christian, he’s a Christian.” Santorum said it again on [Face the Nation](http://www.alan.com/2012/02/19/santorum-defends-his-phony-theology-comment-about-obama): “I accept the fact that the president’s a Christian.” Right. And I accept the fact that Rick Santorum never kited checks at the Congressional Credit Union. It’s fun to accept facts, especially when there’s no controversy before you do the accepting.

In short, the “us” versus “them” here isn’t just real Christians versus phony Christians. Real here means white, and phony black, or at least uppity black. There’s a side play on phony Christian meaning secret Muslim, but then that’s just about the same thing. It’s all very slick, very intentional and very much aimed at squeezing Santorum past Romney in the race to represent [grumpy old white people](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/the-electoral-wasteland/).
