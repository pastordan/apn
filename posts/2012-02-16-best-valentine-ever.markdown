All due respect to Mrs Pastor, this is a pretty darn good Valentine.

It’s actually a drawing done on Sunday by Ashley, one of the church kids. It’s a portrait of yours truly, wearing my orange sweater and standing behind the communion table. Ashley drew this on the bulletin (if you like closely, you can see some of the words bleeding through the page), then set it aside. On Tuesday, I was in the office and just happened to pick up the paper and see this. What a sweet kid, what a sweet picture.
