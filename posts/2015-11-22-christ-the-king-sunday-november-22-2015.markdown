[Revelation 1:4b-8](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=315221167) & [John 18:33-37](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=315221207)

Today we celebrate Christ the King Sunday, or “The Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, King of the Universe” as it is very formally known.

Christ the what now?

If you have not heard of this festival, there is good reason. It was instituted in 1925 by Pope Pius XI, and only caught on with Protestants in the 1970’s. Maybe Pastor Kevin celebrated it, but probably not many of your pastors before him did.

In any case, the purpose of Christ the King Sunday is fairly straightforward: it is a day for Christians to remind themselves that we acclaim Jesus’ sovereignty over the entire creation—you, me, everybody else, all of nature, the stars and the moon, space and time itself. <span class="quoteleft">It all belongs to the one king, Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>

Before I tell you what that means, let me tell you something about why Christ the King came about in the first place. Pius was faced with three challenges in his tenure as pope: secularism, nationalism, and the Italian government. Just as in the US today, people were dropping away from church. They no longer saw it as having a role in their lives.

Then in Mexico, Russia, and later in Spain, revolutionary movements attacked the church and killed priests in the name of national sovereignty.

Back home in Italy, there was an ongoing dispute over who controlled what. Without going too far into the weeds, the Pope used to reign over the Papal States. As the modern republic of Italy formed, those states steadily shrank until the Pope was left with just Rome under his control. Finally, in 1929, the Catholic church and the Italian government reached a deal: the government took Rome, but agreed to recognize what we now know as Vatican City as a separate nation. If you’ve ever wondered why the Pope is treated as a head of state, that’s it.

The short version of all of this is that the Pope felt like the Catholic faith was being disrespected (as the kids say) everywhere he turned. So in response, he instituted Christ the King to remind everybody who was really in charge around here, anyway. That’s not to say that Pius was being completely cynical in creating the feast: its elements are well-rooted in the Christian faith. But he found it useful to put those elements out there in this form. He was quite open about hoping that it would help him in negotiations with the Italians.

We’re not used to thinking of our faith in such political terms, but the fact is, it’s been wrapped up in politics from day one. We only have to look to the gospel to understand this. When the Romans (those pesky Italians again) took over Israel, they installed a puppet government (that’s Herod). The Jews had three basic options in response. They could cooperate, as the Sadducees did; they could fight, as the Essenes did, or like the Pharisees and the Christians, they could try to work out something in the middle. Jesus is sent before Pilate because his opponents—the Sadducees and the Pharisees—push him out in front and say to the Romans, “Psst, he wants to be our king, and get rid of you!” And you know the Romans won’t take kindly to that.

Try as they might, though, <span class="quoteright">Jesus’ enemies can’t quite get Pilate to take the bait.</span> He asks Jesus if there’s any truth to the charges, to which Jesus basically responds, “Look, if I want to be king, it’s not in any way that you understand the term. If I wanted to be that kind of ruler, my guys would be fighting yours, but they’re not. I’m just here to tell the truth.” That might have satisfied Pilate, but unfortunately for Jesus, it wasn’t enough to get him off the hook with his enemies, and off to the cross he went.

If Jesus was not a king along the ordinary lines, then what sort of king was he? There are two answers typically given. One is to say, as John does in his Revelation, that Christ is “the ruler of the kings of the earth.” That is, he is a higher power—a much higher power—and so rules above even the mightiest of earthly royalty.

The other answer is to say, as Paul does in [Philippians](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=315221320), that Jesus is a qualitatively different sort of king. That’s what we’ll read in just a few minutes in our affirmation of faith: that Jesus’ kingship is the paradoxical result of his willingness to humble himself to the point of being a slave executed on the cross. (For the confirmands, what I mean is that you would expect that if Jesus acted like a slave, he would be a slave. Instead, because he acted like a slave, God made him king of the universe. It’ completely illogical, yet here we are.)

There is another way to understand Christ as King, however. [Psalm 27](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=315221361) asks,

The Lord is my light and my salvation;  
   whom shall I fear?  
The Lord is the stronghold of my life;  
   of whom shall I be afraid?

Or as the old hymn “[Leaning on the Everlasting Arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kZY63Kdm4U)” puts it: “What have I to fear, with my Lord so near?” Because God in Christ is the ultimate King, and nobody else is, we need not fear anyone—or anything—else. Look, for example, at the story of [Jesus sleeping in the boat](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=315221765) as a storm threatens to overwhelm it. When the disciples wake him in alarm, he barks at the wind and the seas, “Be still!” Then I imagine he simply rolls over and goes back to sleep, while the disciples stare at one another in terror and amazement. He’s not concerned, because he knows who’s really in charge.

And here’s the thing: before Jesus shows the storm who’s king and who’s not, he has words for the disciples. Again, I imagine him sort of muttering under his breath, “Oh, ye of little faith.” He clearly expects them to have a little more trust that he will take care of them.

<span class="quoteleft">I wish that more people would hear Jesus’ message.</span> We have heard an unreasonable and frankly disgusting amount of fear-mongering this week about Syrian refugees. It’s reasonable to express some concerns about refugees in the wake of the attacks in Paris, although I have to say it’s unjustified. So far, no Syrian admitted to the US as a refugee has arrested for committing a crime, much less perpetrating an act of terror. In fact, of the nearly 1 million people brought into the US as refugees, none of them has later been involved in terrorism. Still, if you worry that it might happen, that’s fine, and I thank you for your caution on my behalf.

But what we have seen from one politician after another goes far beyond the limits of reasonable concern. There have been calls to continuously monitor refugees, to intern them in camps like we did with Japanese citizens in World War II, to give them special ID cards noting their religion, to register them in a database, to ban them from resettling in certain states or to chase out the ones who have already arrived with the National Guard, and to close American mosques. Maybe I’ve missed one or two suggestions along the way. These ideas have come from across the political spectrum, and they are on top of suggestions that we should slow the resettlement process down or even end it altogether. Worst of all, these reactions seem to be driven not by legitimate concern, but in order to secure political advantage, on both sides of the aisle.

Whether or not the US should accept refugees from Syria or other primarily Muslim nations is a question of policy that can be debated either way. Personally, I think it would be heartless to close our doors to people in need, but then I am a pastor. I get paid to be a bleeding heart. So fine, political leaders are within their rights to talk about whether the American refugee program is being run properly and whether we should have one in the first place.

What is not acceptable is to dehumanize people, to make them the objects of hate, suspicion and fear. If this keeps up, it will only be a matter of time before somebody gets the bright idea to kill some Muslims. I sincerely hope that this last week has not soured you on the idea of welcoming a family like the [one we had intended to host]. I especially hope that you would not be put off your ministry of hospitality because you worry about what your friends or neighbors might have to say.

Because the truth is that we have nothing to fear from the [family we knew], or any other refugee family. You’d have a much better chance of getting hit by lightning, twice, than being the victim of a terrorist attack, but that’s not the point.

The point is that <span class="quoteleft">Christ is King, and nobody else</span>. We have nothing to fear because, as the [Heidelberg Catechism](https://www.rca.org/resources/heidelbergcatechism) has it, we are not our own, but we belong—body and soul, in life and in death—to our faithful savior, Jesus Christ. If he truly rules our heart, there is nothing in the world that we need to be afraid of. He loves us and he has freed us from our sins by his blood. Against that, what is a terrorist? He is our Alpha and our Omega, our beginning and our end. Nothing, not bombs or guns or terror attacks, can take us away from him, because he is sovereign over all. Nor can they take us away from the life we are intended to live, or from being the people we are intended to be.

The only thing that can take us away from Christ our King is ourselves giving up on our own humanity. He is a humble king, and gentle, the one who would not bruise a reed or extinguish a smoldering wick in order to establish his rule. He leaves it to us to decide in freedom if we want to be loyal subjects, if we want to follow in the way of his love or walk in the way of fear. You make your own decisions about the number of threats facing our nation, and their severity. You make your decisions about how you want to live your faith. But as for me, I know my path. I will close by paraphrasing the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt: with Christ as our King, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Amen.
