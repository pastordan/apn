Forgive a little navel-gazing for a minute. Or to put it another way, shut up if you don’t like it, it’s my blog.

Anyway, I’ve been having a sub-epiphany in the past couple of days. Call it a realization or maybe just a think. I’ve been putting together the liturgy for a local church gathering in the past couple of days. It’s gone well. I was able to take a couple of abstract and not-necessarily-coherent ideas and turn them into a decent worship service. So far, the people who have seen it have liked it.

So like I say, it’s gone well. Results are good, I like doing it.

So why am I not doing more of it?

Most Sundays, I cobble together services from any number of resources provided by others, mostly because of time constraints. But perhaps I should make time to write more, if not all, my own liturgy. Likewise, perhaps I should spend more time doing it for other people. I’ve got the chops, it’s been a longtime interest, it would put my (ahem) *broad* reading habits to good use, and best of all, it might mean less wrangling with editors over article topics.* It also fits with my long-term plan to do more writing and thinking for the church, rather than about politics. There really are only so many ways you can yell at the same cloud.

So why am I not doing more of it? Probably because I’ve got to sit down and make myself do it. Gah.

Anyway, I’m really just thinking out loud. If you have strong opinions one way or another, feel free to share. Unless you’re Rob. If you’re Rob, save it for the cat posts.

*And if you’re one of my editors and I’ve promised you an article, I’m sorry, and I’ll get right down to work on it, right…now.
