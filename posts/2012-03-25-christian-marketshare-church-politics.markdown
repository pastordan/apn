There’s a large Assembly of God congregation near us that’s pretty obviously working some kind of publicity campaign. Last week, they sent out a professional-looking flyer advertising an awful, bloody-looking Easter pageant that I’m sure was all about Christ’s sacrifice for us sinful types. I’m fairly certain the program was a bit of canned ham, with postcards as part of the package.

This week, another flyer turned up in the mailbox, this one plumping the church’s various worship services. There’s a family service on Saturday night, a “traditional” service on Sunday morning (or whatever passes for traditional in the Assemblies), one for youth on Monday, another for young adults on Wednesday. Like the pageant, the worship opportunities seem pre-packaged: of the four services, three of them came with tag lines like “Spark Worship.” I recognized two of them from the catalogues that come across my desk. The third one probably is a package too, just one I don’t recognize.

It’s not like we don’t use pre-fab elements in the worship services at our church. We do most Sundays of the year. Many churches buy worship resource guides that give them most, if not all, of their liturgy. I’m somewhat more diligent than most pastors in that I draw from many sources, combined with some of my own writing. So this Assemblies congregation isn’t different from us in kind, only in degree, when it comes to laziness in putting together worship. If any of us created worship from scratch each week, that would be all we’d get done during the week.

Still, I wonder about the depth of worship services marketed by brand, essentially. Worship is supposed to be the authentic expression of the community’s faith. Borrowing someone else’s words to make that expression is one thing. We all need poets at one time or another. But an entire “experience” conveniently packaged and labeled makes worship the functional equivalent of a fast-food franchise. “We’ve been going to ‘Spark’ a lot lately. Why don’t we try ‘Inspire’ tonight?”

I’m sure it’s popular. Who knows, the cards might even bring them some new members. But will it produce religious consumers or people with a deep and lasting faith? I hate to be so predictable, but I can’t make myself believe it’s the latter.

**Pee Ess**: If you have a moment, go check out Digby’s longish post on the connections between [Rick Santorum and the Quiverfull movement](http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/quiverfull-of-santorum.html). It’s not beside the point that in the far reaches of conservative Christianity occupied by the Duggars—way out even beyond the Assemblies of God—politics and commercialized pop culture and religion are all expressions of the same thing. The depth of this kind of faith extends about as far as the Heavenly Father structuring the family so that everyone can have a happy, worry-free, materialistic life. If you listen carefully to the Bible studies or devotionals on 19 Kids and Counting and other such shows, they’re just this side of God-flavored self-esteem seminar drivel. They might talk about sin, but there’s no mention of some of the other great themes of scripture: life, death, liberation, redemption, reconciliation, social justice, the ultimate destiny of humanity and the creation. It’s all boiled down to this easily digested consumerist Chicken-Soup-for-the-Soul crap. Like Digby says about Santorum’s female supporters, I’m not going to criticize. They’re chasing their faith, and God bless them for doing so. But it’s not the one I know.
