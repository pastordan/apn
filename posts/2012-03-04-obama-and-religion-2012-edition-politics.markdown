The [New York Times election blog](http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/leaps-of-faith/) carried a pretty decent article the other day, basically on how the GOP candidates have been using religion to “other” Obama:

> This obsession with “worldviews” has been a favorite tactic of the Christian right. In the 1970s, Francis Schaeffer and other activists taught evangelicals to organize against the “secular humanist worldview” that was denaturing America’s Christian values in an acid bath of “humanist religion,” “an exclusivist, closed system which shuts out all contending viewpoints” (that’s the “phony theology” that Santorum was talking about).

Like I say, it’s pretty good. But it could use some tightening up. Like the comedian Andy Borowitz says, “Shorter Santorum: Obama keeps saying he’s Christian, but I think he’s black.”

That’s about the size of it.
