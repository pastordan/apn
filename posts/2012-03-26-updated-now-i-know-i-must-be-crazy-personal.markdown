A glowing crystal just lit up on my car’s dashboard. What does that mean?

Used Volvo, here we come…

**Update**: Mrs Pastor has a point in the comments. Don’t do this at home, kiddies, especially since it means running a car in your home.

[Anyway](http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20120326/FON0101/120326143/2-Lomira-area-men-hurt-high-speed-chase-ends-crash):

> Two Lomira area men were injured Monday in a rollover crash that followed a high-speed chase.
> 
> The Washington County Sheriff’s Office stopped a car on Highway 41 and County Trunk K, said Dodge County Sheriff Todd Nehls.
> 
> “As the deputy was approaching the driver’s door, the vehicle sped off,” Nehls said. “The pursuit reached speeds of approximately 100 mph northbound on Highway 41. The suspect attempted to exit 41 at Highway 28 when he lost control on the off ramp, left the roadway, rolled over several times and came to rest on its top in a hay field.”
> 
> The rollover happened shortly after 1 p.m.

That would be just after I went through that intersection. As in, a cop flew by going the other way just before the end of the video above. No doubt he was headed to Highway 41, just a mile or two away, to join the pursuit. As I imagine it, he would have come up on the freeway just in time to see the chuckleheads flame out from the off-ramp.

You should *definitely* not try that at home.
