Going to be using this one on Sunday. [See here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bfjjaezidupgcxr/Welcome%20of%20New%20Members.pdf) for a better format and some footnotes.

<div style="text-align: center;">+++</div><div><span>It is our honor and privilege to invite *N*. and *N.* to join today Salem United Church of Christ. We welcome especially their children *N*. and *N.* Will you all come forward?</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>At one time, you were strangers to the covenant of promise. But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</span><span> For once you were no people, but now you are God’s people</span>, beloved children of God and fellow travelers on the way.</div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Do you desire to draw near to Jesus Christ in his body, the church?</span></div><div><span>**I do.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Will you turn away from all divisiveness and evil, seeking to do what is right, even though it may be costly?</span></div><div><span>**We will, with the help of God.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Will you promise to maintain the holy fire of your faith, to grow in the Spirit and keep the covenants of your baptism?</span></div><div><span>**We will, with the help of God.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>[For the children:] Will you learn and grow and play with us in Christ?</span></div><div><span>**Yes.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Will you call this congregation to its better self, and will you hold us accountable without running away when we have failed you?</span></div><div><span>**We will, with the help of God.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>*N*. and *N.*, thank you for joining us on the way. Now, for the congregation:</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Do you promise to love and accept these pilgrims for who they are, not who you would like them to be?</span></div><div><span>**We will, with the help of God.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Do you promise to support them on their Christian journey, to pray for them and their children, and to learn and grow with them on the way?</span></div><div><span>**We will, with the help of God.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Do you promise to make room for them in your lives, to know them better, to respect their opinions even when they differ from your own, to allow them to be different, to treat them with honor and respect, and to allow them to correct you when you are wrong?</span></div><div><span>**We will, with the help of God.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>In the name of Christ Jesus, I declare that the dividing wall of hostility has been broken down. </span>You who were once far off have been drawn near. You are our friends and companions.</div><div><span></span></div><div><span>[Let us confess our common faith:</span></div><div><span>In your Kingdom, **remember us, O Lord.**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are the poor in spirit, **for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are they who mourn, **for they shall be comforted.**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are the meek, **for they shall inherit the earth.**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness,   
<span></span>**for they shall be satisfied.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are the merciful, **for they shall obtain mercy.**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are the pure of heart, **for they shall see God.**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are the peacemakers, **for they shall be called the children of God.**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,   
<span></span>**for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.**</span>  
<span>**  
**</span></div><div><span>Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you, </span></div><div><span><span></span>and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake;</span></div><div><span>Rejoice and be glad, **for great is your reward in heaven.**</span></div><div><span>**Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit;**</span></div><div><span>**As it was in the beginning, both now and always, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.**]</span>  
<span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>There remains only one thing needed to bring you into full membership in this local expression of the body of Christ: Will the congregation come forward to lay hands on our new members?</span></div><div><span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Let us pray.</span></div><div><span>Holy God, Lord Jesus Christ, holy three-in-one,</span></div><div><span>Send down your Spirit upon these new friends,</span></div><div><span><span></span>and upon all your servants,</span></div><div><span><span></span>that we might find room in ourselves to welcome the stranger</span></div><div><span><span></span>and receive your promise of new life.</span></div><div><span>We pray these things in the name of Jesus Christ,</span></div><div><span><span></span>who with the Holy Spirit lives and reigns with you,</span></div><div><span><span></span>one God, now and forever. **Amen.**</span></div><div><span></span></div>
