For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him.

—Acts 2:59

People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them. But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, ‘Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.’ And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.

—Mark 10:13-16

It is right indeed, God who is love itself.

From the moment of creation, from the moment of our birth, you have claimed us to be your people and structured the universe to lead us to fall into your loving arms.

In your Son, Jesus of Nazareth, born of Mary, raised by Joseph, dedicated in your holy temple and baptized by the prophet John, you have shown us the promise of a fragile life that came to an end on a cross. In his death you give us hope that death itself has been overcome, and that we will live forever with you and Christ our Savior, loved by you as your children.

With the Holy Spirit, you sustain and guide us in love for you and for the entire creation, which points to you, the source of all love.

So with the baptized and choirs of angels, and for those who cannot speak for themselves, we sing now your praises:

*Holy Holy Holy*  
*Merciful and Mighty*  
*God in Three Persons,*  
*Blessed Trinity*

And so, Father, we ask that you set apart this bread and wine as you have set us apart for your service. Make them for us the body and blood of your son Jesus Christ our Lord, signs and realities of your love for us.

For we remember that on the night before he died, Jesus our brother took bread, blessed it, and broke it and gave it to his friends, saying: “This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this as often as you come together to remember me.”

In the same way, he took the cup, saying, “This is my blood, that has been poured out for you and for many.”

As we celebrate the sacraments of grace in water, wine, and bread, fill us with your presence and send your Holy Spirit upon us and upon our gifts.

By him, with him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all honor and glory are yours, almighty and all-loving Father, now and forever. **Amen.**

The bread is broken to make you whole.  
**Amen. Thanks be to God.**

The cup is poured out to give you life.  
**Amen. Thanks be to God.**

Communion

Jesus said, “Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day.”

Prayer of Thanksgiving

Gracious God, **you have fed us at your table, and you unite us in one faith, one baptism, one Lord who is all in all. Filled with your presence, send us forth as grateful people to show you the love we know from you to the world around us. Amen.**

Dismissal

The Lord bless you and keep you.  
The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you;  
The Lord look upon you and give you peace. Amen.

Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.  
**We go in the name of Christ. Thanks be to God.**
