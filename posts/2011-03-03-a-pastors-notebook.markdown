Long ago, before I was radicalized by the start of the war in Iraq, and before I took to blogging, I had a column of sorts. It was called “A Pastor’s Notebook,” and I sent it out by email.

The subject matter was as broad as the name suggests. It was more or less whatever I was thinking about that week: pondering issues in the congregation, reflecting on daily life, whatever stupid or funny or profound thing that popped into my head. I think it’s time for it to come back.

I’ve been blogging for many years now, at Daily Kos, then Street Prophets, lately at Religion Dispatches. I’ve enjoyed it, mostly. The blog format allows for considerable freedom in form and tone. I could—and did—go all the way from one-liners to prayer services to polemic to philosophy. But blogging also imposes a terrible tyranny of *now*. Everything takes place at lightning speed, and woe to the blogger who doesn’t drink from the firehose of current events. You will be buried under even the friendliest of competition.

I still enjoy talking politics. But lately, I’ve been wanting to do something a little different with my writing. Perhaps more abstract or more polished, or perhaps simply less obsessed with the headlines. I don’t really know, but I mean to find out. The *Notebook* will appear more-or-less weekly. Some weeks it will be essentially a newspaper column on religion, politics, or both. Other weeks, it might be a personal essay, a religious reflection or just some chatter about baking bread. If you don’t like one of those subjects, don’t worry, I’ll label them so you can skip topics you’re not interested in. There is a website where everything is archived. (Er, this one.) There always is.

All of that is the wind up, and here’s the pitch: if you want to receive these e-mails, please respond in the affirmative by clicking [here](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=APastorsNotebook&loc=en_US) and adding your address. If you do not want to receive them, do nothing. I’ll give it a week or two and eventually strip your name from the list. Lord knows we don’t need any more spam out there.

Can I ask you for one more favor, though? If you know someone who might be interested in reading the *Notebook*, please forward this message to them, along with the suggestion that they ask to be added to the circulation. For now at least, word-of-mouth is the model for expanding the readership.

Thanks for reading so far, and hope you enjoy what’s to come.
