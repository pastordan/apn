I officially joined our congregation in Oshkosh last week. Actually, I should say that I was officially welcomed into membership by Franz Rigert, the Wisconsin Conference Minister, who led the ceremony while on a visit to us.

As usual, I wasn’t quite satisfied with the reception of new members liturgy in the UCC Book of Worship. It’s a decent enough service, I just don’t care for it. So I adapted a liturgy I wrote a couple of years back:

### Welcome of New Member

It is our honor and privilege to invite Pastor Dan to join Bethany United Church of Christ today.

At one time, you were a stranger to the covenant of promise. But now in Christ Jesus, all who were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For once we were no people, but now we are God’s people, beloved children of God and fellow travelers on the way.  
Do you desire to draw near to Jesus Christ in his body, the church? *I do.*

Will you turn away from all divisiveness and evil, seeking to do what is right, even though it may be costly? *I will, with the help of God.*

Will you promise to maintain the holy fire of your faith, to grow in the Spirit and keep the covenants of your baptism? *I will, with the help of God.*

Will you call this congregation to its better self, and will you hold us accountable without running away when we have failed you? *I will, with the help of God.*

Pastor Dan, thank you for joining Bethany on the way of Christ. Now, for the congregation: Do you promise to love and accept this pilgrim for who he is, not who you would like him to be? **We will, with the help of God.**

Do you promise to support him on their Christian journey, to pray for him and his family, to learn and grow with him on the way, and to release him when his ministry leads him away from this community? **We will, with the help of God.**

Do you promise to make room for Pastor Dan and his family in your lives, to know them better, to treat them with love and respect, and to allow them to be who they are? **We will, with the help of God.**

[To Dan:] In the name of Christ Jesus, I declare that the dividing wall of hostility has been broken down. You who were once far off have been drawn near. You are our friend and companion. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**

Let us confess our common faith:

In your Kingdom, **remember us, O Lord.**  
 Blessed are the poor in spirit, **for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.**  
 Blessed are they who mourn, **for they shall be comforted.**  
 Blessed are the meek, **for they shall inherit the earth. **  
 Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, **for they shall be satisfied.**  
 Blessed are the merciful, **for they shall obtain mercy.**  
 Blessed are the pure of heart, **for they shall see God.**  
 Blessed are the peacemakers, **for they shall be called the children of God.**  
 Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, **for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.**  
 Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake; Rejoice and be glad, **for great is your reward in heaven.**

**Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.**

[To Dan:] There remains only one thing needed to bring you into full membership in this local expression of the body of Christ: Will the congregation come forward to lay hands on our new member?

*The congregation is invited to come forward.*

Let us pray. Holy God, Lord Jesus Christ, holy three-in-one, Send down your Spirit upon these new friends, and upon all your servants, that we might find room in ourselves to welcome the stranger and receive your promise of new life. We pray these things in the name of Jesus Christ, who with the Holy Spirit lives and reigns with you, one God, now and forever. **Amen.**

About that earlier version: I wrote at a time of significant conflict in the congregation, and it shows. It seems a bit harsh now, but it also seems like it rewards those who would join a church even knowing its problems.
