Sharing a prayer I wrote last night, thinking in particular about a Hispanic community ministered to by a Jesuit friend. Much of the language is drawn from Virgil Elizondo’s excellent book *[Guadalupe: Mother of the New Creation](https://www.amazon.com%2FGuadalupe-Creation-Virgilio-P-Elizondo%2Fdp%2F1570751102)*.

Ever-Virgin, Holy Mary,  
Queen of Mexico and Empress of the Americas,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;who desires only to be our mother:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;listen to the crying of your children.

Our nation has brought trouble upon itself.  
We have made our way forward dark.  
The powerful among us have led us almost to despair  
&nbsp;&nbsp;and laid heavy loads on the backs of the poor.

We have made our society blind   
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the dignity and worth of all people.  
We have allowed ourselves to be dehumanized  
&nbsp;&nbsp;and to dehumanize others,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;individually and as groups.

Mother Mary, pray for us  
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we may be simple, faithful people seeking God,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;filled with the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit.

May our hearts be broken and susceptible to change,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;and through us may a new and more authentic humanity  
&nbsp;&nbsp;blossom to give life to the world.

La Morenita, dark like us,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that the greatest gifts often come  
&nbsp;&nbsp;from those who the world thinks have nothing to offer.  
Lead us away from despair into the way of conversion  
&nbsp;&nbsp;that our hearts might reject all inferiority, worthlessness and   
&nbsp;&nbsp;helplessness, in ourselves and in others.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach us your tender compassion.

Ever-Virgin, Holy Mary,  
Queen of Mexico and Empress of the Americas,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;who desires only to be our mother:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;listen to the crying of your children.

Hear our fear and our anger,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;and release us from their control.

We ask these things as your children through your Son Jesus Christ, and especially on behalf of our own children. Amen.
