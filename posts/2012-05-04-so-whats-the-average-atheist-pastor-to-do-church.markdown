title: So What's The Average Atheist Pastor To Do? [Church]

There’s a story making the rounds (see [here](http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2012-04-30/pastor-lost-faith/54651274/1) and [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/01/clergy-lost-faith-family-jobs_n_1465953.html), among other places) about something called “the Clergy Project,”

> an online support network for pastors who, like her, have lost their faith and found atheism.
> 
> The goal of the project is not to pull pastors from the pulpit, but to provide those who have already lost their faith with a safe place to anonymously discuss what comes next. The hope is they will, like MacBain, eventually feel strong enough to put their families, friends and careers on the line and announce their atheism.  
> “When you leave the ministry, you can lose all of that,” said Dan Barker, a former minister, co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation and a founder of The Clergy Project. “You have to ask yourself, ‘Who am I now?’ … The Clergy Project is a place where their self-respect is restored.”

I can actually say without irony or sarcasm that I appreciate the effort, for basically all the reasons Barker lays out. A pastor leaving the faith—especially someone coming out of a fundamentalist church, and/or somewhere in the South—stands to lose a lot. They would need all the support they could get. This is a productive, positive things for organized atheists to be doing, much better than [lame billboards](http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/atheologies/5823/can_atheist_billboards_kill_religion/) or hating on stupid believers. So, kudos.

That being said, I wouldn’t expect a huge flood of clergy to come out as atheists in the near future. For one thing, most of us know ourselves pretty well, and we have some of the [highest job satisfaction around](http://www.baptiststandard.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6410&Itemid=135). As well, pastors are like anybody: our faith goes (if it goes) in bits and pieces. All of which is to say that if pastors are to become atheists, mostly it will happen *after* they leave ministry.

Besides, as [Candace Chellew-Hodge says](http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/candacechellew-hodge/5937/clergy_come_out_as_atheists/?comments=view&cID=27425&pID=27419#c27425), faith isn’t a simple on-off switch. Most people have complex religious beliefs falling all over the map, not fitting into a neat theist-atheist dichotomy. In fact, I suspect that many of the pastors who have joined the Clergy Project set themselves up with rigid belief structures that can’t accommodate much, if any, doubt.* And yeah, like Candace says in the comments, it’s pretty insulting to be told that because you’re not a doctrinaire orthodox believer, you’re a bad Christian or ripe for the Clergy Project. You work out your salvation with fear and trembling and let me alone to do the same, okay?

One last thing. I don’t judge clergy who leave the faith—you do what you gotta do—but please, don’t do it like this:

> Mike Aus, 48, pastor of a Houston Lutheran congregation of 150 people, found The Clergy Project last year after years of solitary doubt. The day before MacBain’s appearance at the convention, he announced his atheism on MSNBC’s “Up With Chris Hayes.”
> 
> …
> 
> Aus’ congregation, unaware of his change of heart until learning about it on television — on Palm Sunday, no less — decided to disband. Their final service was Easter Sunday.
> 
> “There was anger, yes,” said Joe Vingle, a member of Aus’ Texas church. “Some people had been with Mike for 20 years or longer. Those were the ones that were really hurt. They are feeling that everything they were taught by him is a lie.”

No doubt.

*Saying this almost guarantees that I’ll hear from somebody who went from liberal theology to none. Yes, I know you’re out there. Hi!
