Leaving is difficult even at the best, and it’s no secret that our departure from Salem is not the best. So there are pains and worries and disappointments, big and small, and that is almost all that needs to be said about that. The other thing is that we are understandably not always in the best frame of mind these days. We’re fine, given the situation. A little grumpy sometimes, a little worried. That’s all.

This evening, I read a little about “[making the most of the time, because the days are evil.](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Ephesians+5:15-20&vnum=yes&version=nrsv)” It will take a better man than Paul to convince me to give up my beer. But he’s right. When times are bad, part of being a Christian is finding a way to “redeem” the opportune moment, to ransom your time from its slavery to darkness and bad decisions. That’s the literal meaning to Paul’s words, anyway. It’ll preach this Sunday.

When I was done studying, the boy was looking for a lap to land on, so he browbeat me until I invited him aboard. Within seconds, he was declaring to Mama, “Bear’s hands are trying to kill me.” That’s what you get, kid. Whap.

It is so easy, so damn easy, to get into a bad place in a situation like ours. You start to think that you didn’t get enough help. You become jealous of others’ successes. You become sharply aware of all the ways you’ve been screwed. You start to worry that things won’t work out in the end. You look back in anger and wonder what it was worth, all those years, all those struggles and fights and let-downs. Why the hell did I come here in the first place? Why did I stay?

But then I think about something Jen said the other day: if we hadn’t come here, we wouldn’t have our children.

And just like that, the time is redeemed.

It’s not that meeting our children was worth any sacrifice. Thinking that way leads to an awful slippery slope, and a terrible vision of a God who puts his people through hell just to have the pleasures of family given to others without cost or trouble. No, that’s not right.

What I mean is that when I look back on my time with congregation, I feel not much but frustration and disappointment. It wasn’t all bad, but things didn’t work out, and that’s putting it mildly. I didn’t get to accomplish a lot of what I wanted to do with this congregation. But what if the ultimate reason God brought me (and Jen) to this place wasn’t to help this congregation, but to be in the right place at the right time to welcome Abigail and William into the love of a family?

When you put it that way, it doesn’t deny—let alone take away—the pain of what we’ve been through, with the church or with our children. But it opens up new choices, new ways of receiving what has happened and making good on the time we have left. Given a choice between falling ever further into woundedness and loss or being grateful for Bill and figuring out how to turn this to his best advantage, I know which one I’ll take as the most productive use of the 46 days I have left until my employment comes to an end.
