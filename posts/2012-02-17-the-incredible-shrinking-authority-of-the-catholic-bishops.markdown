Adele Stan has a new piece at AlterNet talking about how the controversy over [providing birth control for employees in Catholic institutions](http://www.alternet.org/news/154166/has_obama_exposed_the_powerlessness_of_the_us_bishops/?page=entire) has exposed fault lines between the bishops and pretty much everybody else. It’s really worth reading to see how tenuous their grip on political power really is. Put it this way: they’re influential because it’s convenient for the media and political elites to maintain the fiction of their influence. They speak for almost no one other than themselves on many issues.

I have long gone back and forth in my own head about this situation. On the one hand, I don’t particularly like my faith being represented by a phalanx of male jackasses in clerical collars telling ladies what to do with their parts, as they were in [Rep. Issa’s hatchet job of a hearing this morning.](http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/211121-planned-parenthood-tweets-picture-of-all-male-panel-at-hearing-on-birth-control)<sup>1</sup> (And like [Sarah Posner](http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/sarahposner/5710/aspirin_as_birth_control%2C_shazam%21_and_the_gop%E2%80%99s_crusade_against_contraception/), I’ve long fulminated about [liberals’ role](http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/5674/liberals_enabled_bishops_in_contraception_battle/) in propping up such travesties.) On the other hand, I often say with a shrug that it just means more business for me, as more Catholics realize the bishops have no clothes when it comes to moral questions.

That’s mostly a joke, since we live in a conservative neck of the woods, and most people who leave a church simply stay home, rather than move to a new denomination. I also say that with the knowledge of how much pain the situation must cause dedicated Catholics.

That’s exactly why this bit of Addie’s piece caught my attention:

> So if the bishops can’t deliver the votes of their flock or control the leaders of the church’s institutions, do they have any power left? Well, yes, they do — for the time being. They have money — money from the collection plates of their parishes, which they’ve been diverting to campaigns against gay marriage, often in states far away from those in which the money was collected. Those dollars, according to a report by Dominic Holden in [*The Stranger*](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/mass-uprising/Content?oid=12587024), a Seattle area newsweekly, are contributed by parishioners who are largely unaware of their ultimate use. They think they are contributing to charity, Holden reports, when, actually, most Catholic charitable institutions received the bulk of their budgets from the government, as contractors for safety-net services. He sites contributions from archdioceses around the country of more than $500,000 to an anti-gay marriage campaign in Maine, directed there by the bishops.But once the bishops’ misuse of collection-plate offerings receives further exposure, I’m betting they’ll lose that power, too.

I’m betting they will too. I have heard from many Catholics, current and former, about the tremendous financial pressure they’re under from the church. It’s a real problem: what I’m told is that the pleas for donations are constant in many parishes, to the point that it’s become a real turn-off for at least these people. The services provided by Catholic institutions—the schools, the hospitals, the social programs—don’t come cheap, especially in a down economy, and with many dioceses staring at abuse-settlement-provoked deficits, money’s tight these days. If the people in the pews start to get the idea that the collection plates are getting diverted to political causes, they will have very little patience. After years of church consolidation, school closures, political gaffes and one round after another of clerical abuse scandals, the bishops have very very little reserve of goodwill left.

Stay tuned. It’s going to be an interesting decade or two in American religion.

<sup>1</sup>Can I just say how astoundingly clueless Republicans seem of late about how these things look?
