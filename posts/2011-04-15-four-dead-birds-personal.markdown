At the start of this week, we heard scrabbling in one of our drainpipes. An ancient pine tree overhangs that gutter, so we assumed that a squirrel or some birds were making a nest in the corner, and thought no more of it.

By Wednesday, it became clear that the noise was coming from *within* the pipe. Clearly, somebody was stuck. It was a warm night and I had a few minutes before our weekly lenten dinner at church. I pulled a flat head screwdriver out of the drawer and disconnected the white, curved downspout at the bottom of the pipe, thinking that it might provide an escape route for whatever unfortunate creature had taken up residence there. As soon as I pulled the sections apart, though, a new problem emerged: thick tufts of grass and twigs poked out of the pipe. Our mystery guest had been building a home there for a while. We could still hear “him” clawing away midway up the pipe.

Being a man, the solution to this difficulty seemed clear enough to me. I began banging on the pipe and pulling at the nesting material to loosen it up. The congregation began to gather in the parking lot. They laughed and suggested ladders to disconnect the top of the pipe as I found rakes to shove up into the battening that resisted our best efforts.

Finally, after some minutes of work, a clump released, fell down in the flower bed. Three dead grackles lay in it, so tightly interwoven with the other material that it took close inspection to get an accurate count. There remained only our friend still in the pipe. I couldn’t dislodge more of the grass, and it was getting on toward dinnertime. I did my best to poke a hole in the clutter, thinking that perhaps the bird could find his own way out with a little assistance. As for the others, I played the part of pyschopomp, conveying the three grackles to the burn barrel the other side of the shed. Sooner or later we’ll get around to making them a funeral pyre, perhaps out of the very pine needles and boughs and other lawn clutter in which they entombed themselves.*

When the bodies were disposed of, I put the rakes and the dislodged drainpipe in the garage and went on with my night. We had only nine for dinner, and another two or three showed up for worship later. The volunteer sextons for the month mistook the evening’s bulletins for last Sunday’s and threw them away, so I had to scramble to make some more copies.

The wind picked up and the temperature dropped overnight. Thursday was cold, grey, and wet. In the afternoon, I picked up the little boy from school and took him along to run some errands with me in town. When we returned, I noticed that the remaining pipe, loosened from the previous evening’s exertions, had fallen off the gutter. I picked it up to see what remained. A little more banging followed, and eventually the remaining grackle, dead, and some more grass and twigs issued forth. The grackle went off to the barrel to join his dead comrades, and the pipe, now painfully cold to the touch, went in the garage with the rest of it. Then I went to get the mail.

I don’t claim to understand bird psychology, such as it is. My best guess is that one or more of the grackles started to build their nest at the very top of the downspout, and as it sank, only worked more furiously to shore it up until the situation became inescapable. But why four birds? They weren’t small, either. No hatchlings, no eggs. These were adults. Their bodies bore no obvious signs of trauma, though I must say I’m even less experienced in bird pathology than I am avian psychology. Were the whole thing not such a mess, I would say it was a mystery.

There’s a metaphor in there somewhere. It might be that when you find yourself in a hole, you should stop digging. Or it could be just the opposite, that sometimes the best (or only) way out of a hole is down, not up. I find that satisfyingly Niebuhrian. Or perhaps it’s that grackles are stupid birds and bad company. Anyway, I guess I need to put some leaf guards over the holes to our drainpipes. I’ll wait until this weather passes. We’re supposed to have wind gusts up to fifty miles an hour today.

*For those of you disgusted by the idea of burning a dead bird with the rest of our garbage, I will only point out that it’s probably not the healthiest idea to breathe in burning trash fumes under the best of circumstances.
