We’ve had an action-packed weekend. Follow the pics for the story:

After shopping with Mama and Bear on Friday night, Bill has decided that he needs his own suit. Here he is in Calvin Klein:

Can you believe that jacket is $100?

Woke up on Sunday, went into say good morning to Bill. He was already dressed up and working on his “machine to destroy the world.” Okay…

Then there was a [big hoop-de-do](http://www.salemwayne.org/2012/04/01/baptismconfirmation-pictures/) at church. After that, we went down to have Easter dinner a week early with my in-laws. Here’s our niece Chelsea looking way more angelic than she deserves:

And Bill looking like Bill:

He is nine, you know.

Jen looking pretty darn angelic herself:

Before lunch, we had an Easter Egg Hunt in Nonnie’s basement:

This one makes Chelsea positively demonic. It’s appropriate to the occasion:

Chelsea found *all* the eggs:
