title: Latin Christmas Hymn (Surgentes ad te Domine) [Liturgy]

As long as I’m digging up various treasures, might as well post this Latin hymn I came across the other day. It was Easter Saturday, in fact, and I was struck by how appropriate this Christmas song would be for the Great Vigil.

I also thought these stanzas were winsome:

> <div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">**O Shepherd good and kind and meek,**</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">**Thy wandering sheep in mercy seek:**</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">**Upon thy shoulder let them lie,**</div>**And bring them to thy halls on high. **

> **So be the prince of hell outdone,  
> The ancient enemy o’erthrown,  
> The subtle thief be shamed away,  
> The wolf be cheated of his prey.**

The whole thing can be found below the fold, and [the book it was taken from is here](http://www.blogger.com/musicasacra.com/pdf/pangelingua.pdf).

We rise to praise thee, Lord of Light,  
Amid the silence of the night,  
For so of old the Fathers taught  
That thou in watchings shouldst be sought,

Who handed down from age to age  
The manner of the war we wage:  
In vigils with the angel host  
We seek thy grace, O Holy Ghost.

For as the Father thou art bright;  
As Christ’s, thy ways for mortal sight  
Too high, O Spirit with them one,  
Who as the Mystic King art known.

Look down upon us, Lord, we pray,  
Whom Satan with his wiles would sway,  
How weak soe’er our bodies be,  
Raise us by thy great might to thee.

Let not that flock by sin or hate  
Be stained which thou didst consecrate  
And save to seek the heavenly road,  
O Christ, by shedding of thy blood.

O Shepherd good and kind and meek,  
Thy wandering sheep in mercy seek:  
Upon thy shoulder let them lie,  
And bring them to thy halls on high.

So be the prince of hell outdone,  
The ancient enemy o’erthrown,  
The subtle thief be shamed away,  
The wolf be cheated of his prey.

For so doth Christ the Lord rejoice,  
While quires of angels raise their voice  
And the sound of organs doth accord  
In the “Thrice-Holy” to the Lord.

In hymns of glory let us raise,  
Father and Son, thy meed of praise,  
And to the Spirit endless laud,  
Three persons in one only God.
