↑Call to Worship

It is good to give thanks to the Lord,   
**to sing praises to your name, O Most High.**

To declare your steadfast love in the morning,   
**and your faithfulness by night.**

For you, O Lord, have made us glad by your work;   
**at the works of your hands we sing for joy.**

↑Prayers of the People

In peace and for the fullness of God in the world, let us pray to the Lord.

*Silent prayer*

We pray for the beauty of creation, for trees and the birds they shelter, for the earth, the sky and the sea, and for all that live in them, that they might flourish and testify to God’s creative power. **Jesus, Lord of love, in your mercy, hear our prayer.**

We pray for those who have lost faith, or who have never known it, that they might trust that God will bring them good, and hope for the future. **Jesus, Lord of love, in your mercy, hear our prayer.**

We pray for those who are unfairly judged, especially those who are judged by human standards and not through the eyes of God’s tender mercy and forgiveness. **Jesus, Lord of love, in your mercy, hear our prayer.**

We pray for those who are sick, hospitalized, injured, who have had surgery, who have been placed in a nursing home, whose lives fail them, and for those who grieve and support them. **Jesus, Lord of love, in your mercy, hear our prayer.**

We pray for our church, and for the whole Christian church. We pray especially that our Search Committee have faith and resolve for its long work, that our own faith, trust and hope blossom through God’s powerful hand, and that our next pastor may know the love of Christ in the new creation. **Jesus, Lord of love, in your mercy, hear our prayer.**

For we pray to you as Christ himself taught us, saying:

*Our Father, who art in Heaven,*  
*  hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come,*  
*Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.*  
*Give us this day our daily bread,*  
*  and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.*  
*And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,*  
*  for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,*  
*  forever and ever. Amen.*

↑Prayer of Dedication

God of love and generosity, who hears our prayers, remember our offerings,   
**and look with favor on the sacrifices we have made for you.**

Hear us when we call on you, O Lord,   
**for we are grateful, and our pride is in you, not in what we possess. Amen.**
