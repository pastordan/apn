Butler tells us that the church in France was a mess in the third century. Christianity never really did sink in with those people. You’ll notice that St. Paul was on his way to Spain, not Gaul, when he was picked up on a charge of breathing while Christian. He wrote to the church in Rome explaining his missionary labors, probably as a fundraiser. He’d been all over Greece, Turkey, Syria, and Israel, but never France. Never even mentioned it. St. Paul was a realist.

Despite that, things had gotten off to a good start with the French church. Then came Decius, and out went a bunch of Christians.[[1]]( "This seems to have become a habit with the French. To be fair, though, killing people has been popular with a lot of folks.") After the heat died down, Pope Fabian sent Denis, along with his friend Rusticus and Eleutherius, to try to build things up again in the north. They settled on the Île de la Cité in the River Seine among a Celtic tribe called the Parisii. They were horrible people. Not much has changed.

Denis, Rusticus and Eleutherius were successful in their ministry. So successful in fact that their efforts aroused the jealousy of local pagan priests. Don’t you hate when that happens?

On this day, along about 275, the three were executed on the highest point around, which was probably a Druidic sacrifice site. Today it’s known as *Montmartre*, Martyr’s Hill. Or maybe it comes from the Roman god Mars. The French aren’t terribly fussy when it comes to these things. Today, you can find artists, rich people, and can-can dancing still. I have no idea why. There are also two churches on Montmartre. Neither of them has anything to do with Denis. This makes no sense at all, but remember where you are.

Denis’ legend says that he was beheaded. That’s bad enough. Even worse, he is supposed to have picked up his head and walked with it six miles while preaching a sermon.[[2]]( "Or maybe he was dumped in the Seine and fished out later, the church being built on his grave. I wouldn't go in the Seine, and neither should you.") My family thinks it’s bad enough when I go on for 25 minutes. At least they have the comfort of knowing that I will shut up eventually. Come to think of it, so did Denis.

Where Denis’ body dropped is where the local Christians built a small chapel and later a larger church on top of it. It’s not the one with the hunchback, that’s another one. To tell you the truth, while it seems like a pleasant enough place, Denis’ church is neither the largest nor the most important in Paris. Nevertheless it’s where the kings of France have traditionally decided to be buried.[[3]]( "During the French Revolution, goons dumped the royal bodies in a pit and dissolved them in lime, but the tombs were preserved for their artistic value. This detail may come in handy in a philosophical debate. Later, the mummified heart of the Dauphin and some 'gray matter' containing bones and a lady's garter were reburied. Aren't you glad you read the footnotes?") Clovis I was the first. He consolidated the Frankish tribes by force. His original name, *Hlodowig,* probably means “Famous Battle.” He could be buried anywhere he damn well pleased. Everybody else just followed suit.[[4]]( "Jim Morrison is buried in Pere-Lachaise. The Lizard King was too good for little old St. Denis.") After Clovis died, his kingdom was divided among his sons Theuderic, Chlodomer, Childebert, and Clotaire. Things fell to pieces after that. They would with kids like that. Clovis’ kingdom wasn’t the only thing that fell apart: the Basilica of St. Denis used to have two towers. After being struck by lightning and taking further damage from a storm, the larger north tower began to crumble. The church decided to take it down before it fell down. They meant to put it back up eventually, so they stored the stone behind the church. There it sits today. In 1992 somebody decided they should get around to fixing the place up. In 2013, the mayor of Paris announced they were going to get serious about the project in 2015. Well, it’s 2015 now, and do you suppose anything’s happened?[[5]]( "They seem to be doing something! We should still check behind the scaffolding, just to make sure, though.")

The basilica and the abbey next door adopted a flag called the *oriflamme*, which featured a sun radiating flames. It’s an impressive symbol, even if it’s not tattooed on Henry Rollins’ back. As Denis became the patron saint of Paris, the French royalty took the flag as their battle standard. While it was raised in combat, the French army swore to take no prisoners. This was meant to intimidate their opponents. It never worked. Being the man to carry the flag into battle was a great honor. It often resulted in getting killed. That part worked. War was weird back then. Things haven’t improved much since. The *oriflamme* was the standard of French armies until the Battle of Agincourt, when the English defeated the French and slaughtered a bunch of prisoners. I wouldn’t want to be reminded of that either.[[6]]( "The Tricolour was of course flying when the French did as much as they could to slow down Hitler's armies. I wouldn't want to be reminded of that, either.")

Denis seems to have left a great deal of conflict in his wake. Artists struggled to figure out where to put his halo. You know, a saint only has so many hands, and six miles is a long way to walk when you’re dead. Then there’s the matter of how much of his head to depict. Some artists showed just down to his jawline. Others go a little farther down his neck. This reminds me of contemporary arguments about beards for some reason. To make matters worse, there was a beef between the monks at the Abbey St. Denis, who said they had the saint’s entire body, and the monks at Notre Dame (that’s the one with the hunchback) who claimed to have the top of his head. It seems like a silly thing to argue about, but there it is.[[7]]( "Medieval monks seem to have needed something to do with their time.")

Another dispute over the ages concerns the name Denis itself. It can be spelled Denis, Dennis, or Denys. I suppose you could include Denise in there. I wouldn’t. We say nothing of menaces, though it seems like he was one in his afterlife. “Denis” may be a corruption of the Greek name Dionysius. But which one? There’s Dionysius the Aeropagite and pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and Dionysius the disciple of Paul. Peter Abelard, a member of the monastic community at St. Denis, joked around that it could be another Dionysius altogether. How many Dionysiuses do you need, anyway?[[8]]( "Jim Morrison was a fan of Dionysius.") Apparently Abelard’s brothers lacked a sense of humor. They kicked him out for insulting the abbey and the kingdom. Abelard had a hard time getting along with people. Except Heloise, and we all know how *that* ended.[[9]]( "He was castrated and wrote a bunch of great letters. You know, the usual.")

Denis is considered one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers[[10]]( "Some people divide the Fourteen Helpers in half: seven 'historical figures' and seven probably legends, including Denis. Some people are mean."), saints whose intercession is considerably highly effective, especially against physical ailments. They’re also comedy gold.[[11]]( "How can you not like Cyriacus, Eustace, Pantaleon and Vitus? Gold! Gold, I tell you!") There is a light rail station named after him, not far from the basilica. People pray to Denis for help with demonic possession and headaches. Personally, I think he should be the patron saint of Congress, but maybe that’s a little too on the nose. Or top of the head, depending on whose side you take.[[12]]( "The top of John Boehner's head is orange. I'll miss him.")
