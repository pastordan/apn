I have largely given up on arguing on the internet. It’s stressful, and I have better things to do, like getting drunk and falling down the stairs.[<sup>1</sup>](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/#1) But apparently we *must* talk about the Catholic bishops and their supposed scruples about contraception. The salient point to remember about this “controversy” is that it is thoroughly and completely manufactured. As [Kevin Drum](http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/02/catholics-do-not-have-moral-objection-contraception) (among many others) points out, Catholics think roughly what all Americans do, which is that employers should provide contraception coverage as part of their health care plans[.<sup>2</sup>](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/#2) It really is the bishops and Rick Santorum who have a problem with birth control, and nobody cares about Rick Santorum.[<sup>3</sup>](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/#3)

Nobody.

But Kevin goes off the rails a bit at the end of his post when he tries to put the non-issue in a moral frame:

> My position on this is plain: the church hierarchy’s objection to birth control is medieval and barbaric. All those Catholic pundits raising hell over the new contraception regs should spend their time instead raising hell with their own church over a policy that’s caused incalculable pain and misery for millions of women around the globe. Instead, they’re all claiming that although *they* don’t have any problem with contraception, they think the government should be more sensitive toward those who do. But it turns out there’s practically no one who does. They’re all pointing their fingers toward a group of people that barely exists.When there’s a societal consensus in a secular country, religious institutions have to accept that, and in America there’s a virtually unanimous societal consensus on contraception. Americans don’t have any problem with contraception. American Catholics don’t have any problem with contraception. And on a public health basis, requiring healthcare plans to cover contraception is common sense. No one — almost literally no one — thinks there’s any problem with it. It’s a non-issue.

This is problematic. First, it subordinates the church’s moral teachings to an amorphous societal conscience. By whose standards do we judge the bishops’ views antiquated? I hold no brief for the inherent superiority of religious morals; that’s not the question here. The problem is precisely that simply waving our hands at “medieval and barbaric” beliefs gives us no good reason to prefer any alternative *as a matter of public policy*. It assumes what seems obvious to most Americans, but doesn’t actually tell us why our intuition should be written into law beyond it being the “consensus” position.

Drum thinks that the church ought to defer to secular social consensus, but again provides no good reason for his position. I think that what he really means to argue is that in a liberal democracy, religious institutions must accept secular reasoning in order to receive secular funding, but that is a very different thing than having to accept social consensus as settled, much less defer to it. For better or worse, the Abrahamic religions have a long tradition of defying social consensus. In fact, it seems to me that they have been at their worst when they’ve gone along with social norms, rather than buck them.

Again, I don’t believe that religious morals are better than secular morals, and I sure have no use for the Catholic bishops and their regressive views on birth control. But we ought to be clear that those views deserve to be put down not because they’re unpopular or religious in a secular setting, but because they’re terrible ideas that don’t do anything to protect or advance women’s health. They are, nevertheless, deeply held by at least the few who do hold them. They deserve respect, as do all moral precepts. They do not, however, deserve funding. This is not a question of religious freedom, and our political system would do well to avoid making it one.[<sup>4</sup>](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/#4)

[<sup>1</sup>]()This never happened.

[<sup>2</sup>]() [Mark Silk](http://www.religionnews.com/blogs/mark-silk/de-mandating-contraception) thinks that this is a legitimate political issue because *white* Catholics think there should be a religious exemption on contraception coverage. I dunno. Kevin’s probably right that it’s Republicans, and Catholic Republicans in particular, who are skewing the results. If so, those votes are “sunk costs” and the administration should waste not a minute chasing them. Given their past performance, I wish I had more confidence in them holding the line.

[<sup>3</sup>]()There’s going to be a lot of talk about Rick Santorum after his win in Minnesota. But repeat after me: [nobody cares about Rick Santorum](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postabcpoll_020412.html). Scroll way down to question 24 b. there: it shows that *19%* of *Republican* voters trust Santorum most when it comes to social issues such as homosexuality, abortion, birth control, etc. That’s quite an improvement over the 4% he drew in December, but guess what changed since then? Michele Bachmann got out of the race, that’s what. Nobody cares about Rick Santorum.

[<sup>4</sup>]() Nobody.
