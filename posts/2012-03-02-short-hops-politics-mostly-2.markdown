- Behold [the GOP’s vision of health care reform](http://www.bugcomic.com/comics/hospital-hospitality/)!
- Speaking of health care, remember when the bishops started moaning about being forced to pay for things that violated their conscience? Remember how some folks responded with the thought that if that were true, [pacifists wouldn’t have to pay war taxes](http://www.mennoweekly.org/2012/3/5/taxing-conscience-one-war-time/)?

Then, an ex-intern of Planned Parenthood got the white-hot investigative report by American Life League on Planned Parenthood sex education blocked by YouTube.

Right now, the Choose Life America site lists representatives of two conservative groups — Wisconsin Family Action and Pro-Life Wisconsin — as the contacts for the Choose Life Wisconsin effort.

Wisconsin Family Action and Pro-Life Wisconsin are some of the most partisan organizations out there. This is little more than an attempt to put the government’s thumb on one side of the social scale and reap some electoral rewards from it.
