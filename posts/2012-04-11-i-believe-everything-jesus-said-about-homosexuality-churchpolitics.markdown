Tired tonight, so no taking on [what a wanker Rick Warren is](http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/dignified-graft-rick-warrens-self.html). Maybe tomorrow. I will pass on [this piece from Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/04/was_jesus_a_homophobe_how_jews_and_early_christians_felt_about_homosexuality_.html) because it touches something that Christians spend a lot of time talking about, believe it or not: what would Jesus think about *x* or *y* in the modern world?

There are obviously many many things that we live with today that Jesus the man had no conception of, homoerotic sexual orientation being one of the more obvious ones. Without going too far down the rabbit hole, [“homosexuality” and “heterosexuality” are very recent developments](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/context/katzhistory.html) in human thought—as in early 20th century recent. Jesus wouldn’t have know from gay, let alone metrosexual. But really, trying to figure out what Jesus “really” said or thought on a subject like this is a losing proposition. The historical Jesus simply isn’t much available to us, if at all. What we have in the gospels and epistles is almost entirely what his followers thought *about* him, rather than the man himself. Even the layer of teaching from the early church is equivocal on many issues and distorted by the passage of time. The best you can do is synthesize the values and hope you’re not too far off.

Sometimes conservative or “red letter” Christians pick on liberals because we supposedly aren’t faithful enough to what Jesus obviously meant, except it’s not usually so obvious. And where do you get off, they want to know, deciding that something’s okay simply because Jesus didn’t get around to speaking out against it? They point out, with some justification, that Jesus had no problem with the Jewish law, which specifically forbade homosexual intercourse.

But the point of wondering what Jesus had to say on homosexuality, and many other subjects, isn’t to argue from absence. It’s to remind people—in the face of selective and sometimes even what we might call [inventive literalism](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2012/02/18/the-biblical-view-thats-younger-than-the-happy-meal/)—that there is a lot we don’t know about how to apply the gospel message in the world. So maybe a bit of humility is in order?
