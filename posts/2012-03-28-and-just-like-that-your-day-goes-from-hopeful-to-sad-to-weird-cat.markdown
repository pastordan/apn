Callie showed up on our porch again this afternoon. I didn’t have anything that needed to be done immediately, so I thought we’d take her in to see the vet. It’s something we’ve been talking about, with an eye eventually to bring her indoors and try to find her a home.

It couldn’t have been easier. I got down our cat carrier, tossed a bowl of food in the back. She went right in after it, didn’t even complain when the door shut behind her. She didn’t like the car too much, though. But as soon as we let her out of the crate at the vet’s office, she popped out and started rubbing on the tech and the doctor when he came in.

It took all of thirty seconds for the doctor to figure out that she was pregnant. He took her in the other room for a quick ultrasound, and came back with the words, “There’s three or four of them in there.” Not only that, she’s pretty far along. Doc thought her due date would be in about two weeks or so.

All of a sudden, I was going to be a foster grandpa again. I cannot deny that the thought was pleasing. Who wouldn’t enjoy watching inches-long kittens open their eyes, start crawling, then explore their world with a wiggle and a hop? If you think you could resist the charm, I’ll show you some of the pictures we took the last time.

But the doctor and I agreed that before we got too far along, we’d test Callie for feline leukemia (often shortened to fe-leuk) and FIV, which is HIV, but for cats. If she had either of those diseases, there wouldn’t be much point in getting her a full course of vaccinations. Either way, she’d get dewormed and treated for other parasites. They went off to work on her while I took Bill home for supper.

You probably already know where this is headed. They called after about half an hour. I could tell something was wrong when the tech told me to hold for the doctor, who would explain the situation.

Callie’s positive for exposure fe-leuk, which doesn’t mean anything good in the long run. Probably, she’s got the disease, and will die from it in 3 or 5 years or so, assuming nothing else gets her in the meantime. Outdoor cats don’t have a very long lifespan anyway, so Doc said not to worry too much about her days being cut short. If it weren’t for the leukemia, it’d be something else. But it also means that Callie’s kittens either already have the disease, or will pick it up shortly after birth. About three in four of cats born to a mother with fe-leuk will die sometime before the age of five, with the fourth going on to a longer life (again assuming that the coyotes don’t get them). There’s also a risk of birth defects.

The real bummer is that Callie’s not a good candidate to be an indoor kitty. She *probably* wouldn’t give our cats leukemia, but it would be taking a risk. Between that, the shortened lifespan, the cost and bother of vaccinations and spaying, and all the other assorted pains of bringing a new cat into the house, well, it’s probably just easier to leave her an outdoor kitty. Bill was sad when I explained all of this to him. He understands, but he thinks of Callie as a friend already, and what kid would want one of their friends to be sick?

Where the weird comes in: after Bill and I brought her home, I let her out of the crate onto the porch. She stopped a moment to sniff the food bowl, but almost immediately hopped to the door. The next time I looked, she was gone. Perhaps she’ll come back to have her babies with us, perhaps not. In other words, we’re left with this strange, ambiguous relationship. With a cat. Who might wind up dead tomorrow morning.

Great…

Meanwhile, somebody else came around tonight:

Dollars to donuts, somebody else will be bringing kittens to see us before long.

Doc says we’ve got a sign on our back porch that says SUCKERS on it. I believe him.
