*My Pentecost sermon:*

[Acts 2](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=141660691) & [Romans 8](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=141660742)

I am going to pass up the usual exposition this morning. Our time is limited, and our texts are fairly self-explanatory.

In Acts, we hear of the coming of the Spirit on the church, or really the Jesus movement. God bestows the Holy Spirit upon the disciples in a miracle of speaking: they speak “other tongues.” It is also a miracle of hearing. Foreigners hear the disciples’ speech in their native language. It is lastly a miracle of renewal. Strengthened by the Spirit, the church begins its ministry in earnest.

Paul, meanwhile, spells out for the Romans what it means that Christians have received God’s Spirit. If you have the Spirit, he says, then you are a child of God, just like Jesus. And if you are just like Jesus, then you will inherit the same estate as Jesus. Therefore, you need no longer be “slaves to fear,” but people freed by the love of God.

From these starting points, we can draw two conclusions.

The first is one suggested to me by my wife after last week’s sermon on becoming a better person. She says, and I quote, “you don’t become a better person to join community. Being a part of community makes you a better person.” The disciples are a fearful, barely organized mess before the gift of the Spirit – which they receive in community.  But once they have the Spirit, they learn and grow together in what it means to be followers of the risen Christ. In fact, it is the gift of the Spirit that makes them a unique community, called together by God for mission.

The foundations of our faith are in community. Christ and his disciples were a community. After his death and resurrection, they went on to form a new, and ever-expanding, community. There is no such thing as a Christian without community. The Spirit is a gift to the church, not to individual believers separated from one another.

The other lesson to be drawn from these texts is that the church is not to be as Paul says, a slave to fear. We are a free people. We have been freed from fear by God’s gift in the Holy Spirit. Specifically, we have been freed from fear so that we can do the hard things. Paul says that “we share in Christ’s sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.” He goes on to explain what he means later in this same chapter, in [those words I love to preach at funerals](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=141660855):

> What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else? Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written,  
>      ‘For your sake we are being killed all day long;
> 
>       we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.’
> 
> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

We are Christians. We have nothing to fear and nothing to lose. And just to make the point absolutely clear, the promise is not to you or me individually. It is to us.

So we are better people for being part of a community, and we are freed from fear. Both facts come about as part of the work of the Holy Spirit. While the gift of the Holy Spirit is free, as are all God’s gifts, it is not without purpose. We have been given the Spirit for a reason. As I said just a few minutes ago, the church is a community called together by God *for mission*. The strength of community is given for us to pass it on to those in need. The freedom from fear is given so that we might carry out our mission without worrying about what might go wrong, or worse, what might go right.

Earlier this week, I gave some of you a heads-up about a challenge I now want to lay before you all. Family Promise, a ministry that works with homeless families in Washington County, has a program with twelve different congregations in the county. Four or so times a year, each congregation takes in homeless families and houses them for a week in their church building. They provide dinner, spend time with the families, let them sleep overnight, and in the morning, help them get out the door to a day program in West Bend.

The Consistory and I talked about Family Promise at our last meeting. They told me “we’re not quite ready to think about housing families. But if somebody like Peace church is doing it, we’d like to help.”

Well, in fact, Peace church is doing it, in conjunction with Holy Trinity. In fact, they are scheduled to take in their first families the week of June 27<sup>th</sup>.

Now, if you can believe it, today is the eleventh anniversary of my ordination. Yes, eleven years ago today, and it was a Pentecost Sunday. And in that time, I have learned a thing or two, if you can believe it.

One of the things I have learned is that I am almost powerless to motivate congregations. I can make suggestions and help set the values of a community, but there’s really nothing I or any other pastor can do to make you want to do something. Either you want to do it or you don’t.

In this case, either you all are going to want to participate in the program, or you’re not. I’ll ask some of you individually, because general announcements don’t work as well as individual requests. But when it really gets down to it, either you’ll want to do it or you won’t.

So we’re just going to leave it at this. I’ll tell you what I’m hoping for, and why. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, well, we’ll try something else.

I’m happy to put this all together, find out what we need to do and get people lined up to fill those slots. But I hope that won’t be necessary. I hope that one of you will be willing to step up to the plate and organize this ministry on behalf of our community.

I say that not because I can’t or don’t want to, but because ministry belongs to the community, not to me. If you do this because I asked you to do it, it will always be something Pastor Dan asked you to do. But if you do this because you want to do it, it will be something *we* did together. In other words, you all will become better people by taking an active part in community.

So take a little while, think it over, and if you feel so moved, let me know. But I can assure you that you have nothing to fear. Homeless people aren’t scary, and they don’t smell bad, and it’s not contagious. The fellow members of your church aren’t going to criticize you for stepping up, and they’re certainly not going to make fun of the way you do it.

And what, really, is the worst that could happen? You could die doing it? Even in that unlikely event, you will still be with God and Christ, as Paul tells us. As awful as it would be, it wouldn’t be the end of the story.

To recap then: you and your community become better people, you have nothing to be afraid of, and everything to gain. And all you have to do is what the disciples did that first Pentecost 2,000 years ago: sit still and let the Holy Spirit fill you. I hope and I pray and I am confident that you all are capable of that. Amen.
