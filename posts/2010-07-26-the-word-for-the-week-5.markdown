[Exodus 16 & 17](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=147708414)

When we [last saw the Israelites](http://www.changingthescript.com/2010/07/word-for-week_11.html), they were standing at the far shore of the Red Sea, struggling to come to terms with the reality that they had been claimed by the Lord, a very powerful and very strange God. We meet up with them again today at the start of their journey in the Sinai. They still don’t get it.

Notice, for example, that they complain against Moses and Aaron about the lack of food in the wilderness. But Moses and Aaron didn’t bring them out into the desert: the Lord did. Notice also how quick the Israelites are to want to give up on the Exodus project: if only we had died in Egypt! they wail. Sure, we would have been slaves, but we would have had full bellies! But you two just brought us out here to starve us to death!

And so it goes. At every turn in the story, the Israelites get it wrong:

- God tells them that he will provide bread for them. They see the manna and ask “What is it?”
- In another telling of this same story, God promises them bread, and they complain that they don’t have any meat. Here the quail come even before they can complain.
- God tells them to collect just enough for one day at a time. They go out and try to bring in as much as they can.
- God tells them only take as much as you need for each person, but they try to grab as much as they can.
- God tells them that on the day before the Sabbath, they should gather twice as much as usual, so they will not have to work the next day. They go out and try to collect it as usual on the Sabbath.
- God tells them that he will provide bread and meat so “you shall know that I am the Lord your God.” They don’t believe him, apparently. When they get to Rephidim, it’s back to complaining to Moses: “give us water to drink,” and when he chews them out, they say “Why did you bring us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?”

The basic problem here, in the words of [Terence Fretheim](http://books.google.com/books?id=hU546phUN0oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Terence+Fretheim+Exodus&source=bl&ots=R-yhCFB8YQ&sig=Br2EHR0hfraWs9xEqLDVrSoBi-Y&hl=en&ei=_g9WTPa6BZP-ngeNruyBAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false), is that the Israelites let a *food crisis* turn into a *faith crisis*. They are unable to discern God’s *presence in the ordinary*, which leads them to deny God’s *activity in the extraordinary*. Or again, because they cannot see the *new creation* that God sets before them in the manna and quail and water from the rock, they are unable to embrace the *new identity* as the people of God that the Lord has set before them. (I’m taking all of this from Fretheim.)

We’ll come back to some of this in future sermons, but let me hit a couple of things very quickly here. Just as the Lord’s creative power serves the cause of liberation when Moses parts the Red Sea, so too the power of creation is at work in this story. God creates the manna, we are given to understand, and brings the water from out of the rock, where there was no water before. Even the quail, which are an “ordinary” food, are brought to the Israelites because their creator, the Lord, commands that they serve his people. So here is the continuing theme of the power of creation and redemption being essentially the same thing.

Creation and liberation are also essentially the same force here. God provides for his children in the wilderness, but not just as a stopgap, a temporary measure until they are able to provide for themselves again. Instead, God’s provision for the Israelites is meant to form in them that new identity, one that is free from material worry.

The economics are strikingly anti-capitalist, as we would say today. The Israelites don’t have to pay anything for the manna and the quail. More to the point, they don’t have to pay anybody. In fact, they couldn’t, even if they wanted to. There’s no way to store the manna, and the people are mysteriously unable to collect too little or too much. It’s just enough, all around, with no way to get a little ahead of the game. Even more striking for this time, there is an element of rest built into the provision. The Lord is so good to his people—to his whole creation—that he gives them a day off each week, which is quite the statement in a time when just eking out a living was the rule.

As I say, all of this is meant to change how the Israelites behave. The Lord wants them to become people who can trust him in him to provide for them, and being freed from the anxiety of want, to become people who don’t feel a need to exploit or oppress one another. They don’t get it. We’ll talk more about that in a week or two with the Ten Commandments and the Golden Calf.

For now, I’ll let the subject go with the reminder that these are stories the Israelites told about themselves. So from their perspective, it’s not that they don’t get it. It’s that we don’t get it. And of course Christians consider themselves adopted extensions of the Israelite nation. We see ourselves in these stories as well. Meaning, we don’t get it either.

Of all these many things that we don’t get, I want to focus in on just one. The whole point of this manna and quail (and water) exercise is to answer that question, “Is the Lord among us or not?” Time and time again, the Lord tries to show the Israelites that he is indeed present among them in the ordinary occurrences of the day, so that they can trust his activity in the extraordinary happenings. It is only the hardness of their hearts that prevents them from believing.

I don’t believe that we are as bad as the Israelites are depicted as being here. For that matter, I don’t believe the Israelites are as bad as they’re depicted. I think this is a matter of exaggeration for the sake of emphasis: we’re going to tell ourselves that we’re really really bad so we get the idea that this stuff is really really important.

Even if that’s not the case, and we really are as totally depraved as the Israelites, I’m not inclined to give a finger-wagging sermon. Not my style.

But I do think that this text, like many others in the Bible, raises some important questions. Do we know that the Lord is among us in the ordinary events of each day? How do we know that? How do we testify to God’s presence in our day-to-day lives? Which is to say, how do we recognize that presence? How do we tell other people about that presence?

And look, I’m not talking about Hallmark moments here. I’m talking about how do we recognize that in the midst of our families, in the midst of this one family we call the church, there is a force at work who creates us, who re-creates us, who provides for us, who buys us out of slavery and sets us free, who calls on us to take on a new identity based on trust and thanksgiving and loving mutuality for one another. That force that we call the Lord, or more recently the risen Christ, is in our midst at work by and for and through us in the most mundane things. God is there in our endless meetings. God is there in our potlucks. God is there when we decide to worship outside on a Sunday morning, or not. God is there, God help us, even when we are putting a new roof on the schoolhouse or remodeling bedrooms at the parsonage. The Lord is in our midst, and at work. The Lord is present in the ordinary, and can be trusted in the extraordinary.

To put that last bit somewhat differently, if you know—and if you acknowledge—the ways in which God is at work in the day-to-day moments of your life, then you will be able to trust him when it counts. Or again, if you know that the Lord is in your midst when you receive your daily bread—your manna—then when you die, you will be able to meet your end with more style and grace than would be possible otherwise.

So it is at the very heart of our mission as a church, as a family, to stop and notice the presence of the Lord in our midst. We’ll talk more about that as we go on through the fall. I think we’ll have some opportunities to look at how we might acknowledge God’s presence as we go along.

But I want to close today with something from my book, which will be out very shortly. I try not to talk much here about the book because of the subject matter, but I will tell you that I end by agreeing with the statement that there may be no more radical challenge to contemporary politics than a simple table grace. I think that’s true. For when we give thanks to whom thanks belong, we not only testify to his presence, but we participate in the challenge he poses to the workings of the world. And so at the very end of the book, I give this as a sample prayer, from a table grace that I use at our house:

> Gracious God, loving Father:  
> You are our hope.  
> We know that only you can keep us safe.  
> Only you can bring us joy.  
> We give you thanks for all your gifts to us,  
> and we pray that you lead all people into your future  
> and fulfill the promise of your love for us.

This is how you acknowledge the presence of God in the ordinary and stake your faith in his activity in the extraordinary. May that prayer come true in its speaking, and may we, the children of God, be ever mindful that the Lord is indeed among us, today and every day. Amen.
