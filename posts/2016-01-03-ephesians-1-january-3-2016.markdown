[Ephesians 1:3-14](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=318864664)

I know that today’s lesson from Ephesians must seem confusing, and by “confusing,” I mean “I wouldn’t blame you if you went actively, horridly cross-eyed halfway through it.” There is a lot going on here in not very much space, all jumbled together in some kind of insanely twisted knot. Unbelievably, it is one long and very convoluted sentence in the Greek. How the scholars ever parsed it out, I have no idea.

Once you have disentangled your eyeballs, however, and read the thing a few times, you start to pick out the themes. What it boils down to is Paul talking about two interlocking mysteries.

The first of these is that Christ has brought us near to God through himself. More precisely, God the Father saw fit to draw us near to himself through Christ:

He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will.

You’ve heard me talk about how the early Christian church attracted pagan almost-converts to Judaism, and this is indeed what Paul’s talking about here. The people this letter is written to have been adopted into the Jewish family, overcoming the alienation, hostility and sin that have kept them separated from the Jewish God:

In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us.

God has bought all people back from the Devil. In Christ’s death on the cross, all our sins and failings are cancelled out, and we are given the free gift of a new relationship with God.

Note two things about this mystery that Paul names: one, it is not to you as individuals, but to us as a shared community. There is no drawing near to God without drawing near to one another. Two, as it turns out, God had a plan to make this adoption happen, and he set that plan in motion a long time ago:

He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love.

Even before the creation of the universe, God knew who he wanted to make his people through and in Christ. The plan is just now getting into action, according to Paul. Perhaps you can spot the connection to this morning’s gospel lesson:

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Christ is an intricate, intimate, and necessary part of God’s pre-existing plan of salvation. That infant whose birth we celebrate at the Christmas is Emmanuel, God with us. He builds God’s presence into the very fabric of creation and directs that creation toward the long march of the fulfillment of God’s plan. Before there was anything, there was God’s love drawing the universe in, little by little.

That declaration reveals in turn the second of Paul’s mysteries: God has a plan to save us! He’s had it all along! And not just us, but everyone, and everything:

He has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ, as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.

So it turns out that although God had a plan to win us back, we’re just the start of a much larger plan:

In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory.

The more accurate way to put this is that Paul’s listeners were the first to set their hope on Christ. We’re 2,000 years down the chain. Either way, the point remains the same: we are part of something much bigger than ourselves. The only thing grander than God’s plan to save us from ourselves is God’s plan to save the cosmos, to “to gather up all things in him” in the primal unity that has been missing ever since Adam and Eve decided to eat that stupid apple.

I find it difficult to put the staggering scale of this project into words. God intends to gather all things in him: everything from the smallest atom to the furthest star millions of light years away, and everything in between. Every blade of grass, every snow flake, every person, to be united with God to live to the praise of his glory. It is incomprehensible.

Or all but. A friend points me to [Psalm 84](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=318864923), which reads in part:

Even the sparrow finds a home,  
   and the swallow a nest for herself,  
   where she may lay her young,  
at your altars, O Lord of hosts,  
   my King and my God.  
Happy are those who live in your house,  
   ever singing your praise.

Compared to the cosmos, let alone to God, we are really not much bigger than a sparrow. Yet even the sparrows and the swallows find a home in the temple of God, where they can live in love and through love, the love of God for all of creation. The point is not to dwell on the details—how are all those sparrows and swallows going to get into the temple, and who’s going to clean up after them?—but to recognize the power, the scope, the sheer overflowing abundance, of God’s love. God loves everybody and everything, and for that, we should give him thanks and praise, says Paul.

So there are the mysteries Paul lays out for his audience: <span class="quoteright">in Christ, God means to save us</span>, and that salvation is only the beginning of a bigger plan to save creation.

There is a promissory character to this passage: Paul says that we were “destined” for adoption, according to God’s purposes. We are the first (or almost the first) to “set our hope on Christ.” We are “marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit,” which is “the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God’s own people.” God has made a lot of promises to us, some of which have come true, others of which we are still waiting on. We have been brought into God’s family, but as yet, not all things have come together in unity.

And here we need to remind ourselves once again that the promises are made to us, not you and me and the rest of that lot as individuals. There is no drawing near to God, there is no participating in the life of God, that does not involve community. In community and through community we receive the promises of God to be reunited with humanity and with creation itself. <span class="quoteleft">To participate in community is itself salvation</span>, and to live to the praise of God’s glory.

Because we are purposed for drawing one another and all creation closer to God. This is why you have been saved; this is why your life matters. Without you, God could not accomplish his plan to heal and reunite the cosmos. That’s right—the plan that began before creation and involves life, the universe, and everything, comes down to this: your willingness to sit here in church, to take communion, maybe stay for coffee hour, maybe go to see a homebound member. The grandest cosmic mystery of salvation begins with the smallest of steps, namely yours, the step you take today to come closer to the people you encounter.

That is indeed a mystery capable of crossing your eyes permanently if you think too hard about it, but it is also indeed apparently what God wants for us. And blessed be God for that. Amen.
