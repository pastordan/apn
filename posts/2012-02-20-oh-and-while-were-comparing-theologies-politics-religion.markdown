Last weekend, out of my phony theology—surprisingly similar to the president’s—I stood outside in the wind, in single-digit temperatures, and waited through a 21-gun salute to bury a veteran of the US Army.

Wednesday, because of my phony theology, I went to see a member of my congregation whose feet and hand were shattered in a car crash.

Thursday, because of my phony theology, I took dinner to an elderly couple so the husband wouldn’t drive them (unsafely) into town.

On Saturday, because of my phony theology, I tried to get food donations to a pantry that could use them. Okay, that was very naughty of me, I will admit, since the donations came from a chapter of Planned Parenthood.

And today, because of my phony theology, I drove an hour-and-a-half to visit a child in a burn ward.

And what, Mr. Santorum, did you accomplish with your theology this week? Oh, right. Your theology entitled you to tell women what to do with their bodies and question the president’s character. Christ will be proud of you.

People will say how good it is of me to do all of these things. They might, anyway. But you know and I know what my “phony theology” says is that we should all be about doing these humble acts of lovingkindness. It’s not quite being a lobbyist for well-heeled companies, or buying and selling corporations, but it is a living.
