title: The 50-Year "Failed Experiment" of Youth Ministry [Church]

According to some [pioneers of youth ministry, it just doesn’t work](http://www.christianpost.com/news/church-services-separated-by-age-un-biblical-say-former-youth-pastors-52964/). Of course, they being conservative Evangelicals, they can’t leave it at that:

> NCFIC Director Scott T. Brown told The Christian Post that today’s modern concept of youth ministry is a “50-year failed experiment.” Brown said that when he was a church leader in the ’70s and ’80s he could have been the “poster boy” for the youth ministry movement in California. However, he said he now feels that dividing children from adults at church is an unbiblical concept borrowed from humanistic philosophies.

You know, I really don’t agree with this business of pawning off every failure of the church on “humanistic philosophies” or “secularism” or even—heavens forfend—”liberalism.” The church is ultimately much stronger for being in dialogue with the world outside its walls. We need the learning of secular society, need to be open to new and different ways of thinking and doing. Sticking strictly to the “biblical” is unhealthy: it misunderstands scripture itself, which is hardly monological, and it leaves the church vulnerable to the temptation of bibilolatry. And for gosh sake, what is wrong with just saying, “We tried something, it didn’t work, time to try something else?” Quit trying to blame your failures on somebody else.

I do actually agree with this:

> “The church has become divided generationally,” Brown said. “It’s not doing what Scripture prescribes and is actually doing something foreign to Scripture by dividing people by age or by life stage.”

That’s true. Scripture is very clear that learning about God is for all, whether young or old. I don’t necessarily see anything wrong with sending the kids back for Sunday School during a sermon they’re not going to understand: some division by age is okay. But what they’re talking about here is more than just half an hour in the church basement. Youth services in the Evangelical world really do become a completely separate affair, at different times and even in different locations than the adult ministries. It’s easy to see how someone could become dubious about that.

But this part I *really* don’t agree with:

> “I look back and realize I did more harm to families than I ever imagined,” Dellinger says in the film. “I see that more as I look back because I was usurping the authority of parents, especially fathers by having their children’s hearts turn towards me – with their permission.”
> 
> …
> 
> “We have to go back to what does the Bible say? There’s something fundamentally wrong with the church’s drive to say we can do a better job of raising your children than you can,” Dellinger highlights. “God has appointed fathers to lead their children; not for someone else to do it just because they have a college degree or some seminary training. That does not qualify someone to all of a sudden become the spiritual leader of your family.”

There is a grain of truth in here, in that too much ministry with children and youth seems to be premised on opportunity cost to the parents, that is, that it’s a more efficient allocation of time to have a “specialist” instill values in your kids than do it yourself. That’s dumb and wrong, to put it mildly. Parents are the primary teachers of faith and values for their children. But the way they teach their children is by relationship, and that job isn’t limited to fathers, or mothers. “Father knows best” isn’t any better a model than “church knows best,” and yes, it’s distressing how often the two go together. “Modern youth ministry” may well be a failure, but I suspect it has less to do with luring children from the comforting strength of their father’s authority and more to do with the failure to instill a healthy, ever-unfolding relationship with the church and the living God it loves and serves.
