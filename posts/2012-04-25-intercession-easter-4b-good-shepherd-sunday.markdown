Based on [Ezekiel 34](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=202316685) and [John 10:11-18](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=202316760).

<div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">Loving Father, faithful Shepherd, Spirit who knows us better than we know ourselves, hear our hearts and voices lifted to you in prayer.</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">*Silent Prayer*</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">**</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">Against all loss, against all loneliness, against all separation and anxiety, O God, strengthen the weak. Good Shepherd, **Hear us and heal us.**</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">For those who suffer from cancer, diabetes, and heart disease; for those who face surgery and those who are recovering from it; for those living with chronic illness and pain; for those with mental illness, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia; for new mothers and children; and for all those in medical need, especially…we pray that you would heal the sick. Good Shepherd, **Hear us and heal us.**</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">We are caught by fear, Lord our God, weighed down by old insult and emotional injury. Repair our wounds and set our breaks straight. Teach us to breathe in your peace and newness of life. Help us to let go of old grudges and resentments and make us vulnerable to begin again with those to whom we are connected. Bind up our injuries and teach us to laugh again. Good Shepherd, **Hear us and heal us.**</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">There are those who have left us, so many friends and family. The world and our own community are divided, suspicious, angry and resentful. We can no longer follow a single path, but each goes his or her own way without regard to the needs of others. Bring back to us those who have strayed from our community. Seek out those who are lost, who need our community, who need our love. Mend our tears and reunite our divided politics. Gather us as a true community, a single flock once again, a place where the comfort of life together can be made known to the broken world. Good Shepherd, **Hear us and heal us.**</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">“I will feed them with good pasture,” you promise us, and: “they shall feed on rich pasture in the mountains of Israel.” Yet we know that many are hungry in our land and around the world. Feed the hungry, good God, and use us to do it. Give us generous and giving hearts, and open us to the world of need beyond our walls. Feed your people with compassion to help those in need and with justice to wonder why they must be in need at all. Good Shepherd, **Hear us and heal us.**</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">You are the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for the sheep. You are faithful to us even unto death. Teach us to stand fast with one another as you stand with us. Help us to know you and one another even as you know us. Make us know and listen to your voice when it calls to us. Lift us out of every hopelessness, protect us from every wolf, and make with us a covenant of peace to tie us together with you and with one another. Good Shepherd, **Hear us and heal us.**</span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 12.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: small; letter-spacing: 0px;">We know that you, the Lord our God, are with us, and that we are your people. Join us with the saints in eternal life across time and space in giving you thanks and praise, knowing that we are your sheep, the sheep of your pasture, and you are our God, who loves us and calls us your own, now and forever. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**</span></div>
