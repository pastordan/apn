title: Who Bothers To Kill The Clergy Softly? [Church]

A former mentor once asked me how I liked doing ministry in Central Pennsylvania. He’d spent some time there himself, back in the day. “The Pennsylvania Dutch are the rudest people I’ve ever met,” he told me. “They don’t even bother to stab you in the back. They just spit in your eye, then stab you in the face.”

It’s like that all over the place these days. There aren’t many places or traditions where members of the clergy are given a whole lot of deference anymore. Catholic priests and some Lutheran pastors can get away with “because I said so.” The rest of us rank somewhere below hairdressers and slightly ahead of dentists in terms of authority. I kid, but it really is true that people feel more and more entitled to say incredibly rude stuff to pastors (and other professionals) these days.

Worse things can happen. According to [the ARDA blog](http://blogs.thearda.com/trend/religion/killing-the-clergy-softly-congregational-conflict-job-loss-and-depression/):

> An online study published in the March issue of the Review of Religious Research found 28 percent of ministers said they had at one time been forced to leave their jobs due to personal attacks and criticism from a small faction of their congregations.

That sounds low to me, as does this:

> In the 2006-2007 National Congregations Study, [9 percent of congregations](http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Analysis/NCSCUM/NCSCUM_Var603_1.asp) reported a conflict in the last two years that led a clergyperson or other religious leader to leave the congregation.

Anyway, yes, it’s usually a small faction in the congregation that’s responsible for the trouble. This is for no sounder reason than that most people aren’t ginormous jerks. Only a relatively few people are unhappy enough to make waves; where the trouble starts is when the majority doesn’t want to deal with them appropriately. That lets the conflict escalate, of course, but less obviously, unhealthy systems tend to accumulate unhealthy members. So the longer you let the crazy uncle run things, the worse things get.

This is all very true as well:

> Ministers who were forced out of their jobs because of congregational conflict were more likely to experience burnout, depression, lower self-esteem and more physical health problems, the online study found.
> 
> In addition, more than four in 10 ministers forced out of their jobs reported seriously considering leaving the ministry.
> 
> A separate survey by Texas Tech and Virginia Tech researchers of 55 ministers who were forced out of a pastoral position found a significant link with self-reported measures of post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

Been there, done that. Even when you know it’s not your doing, it feels like a failure. Aren’t pastors supposed to be beloved by their congregations? And because the conflict tends to be aimed at the person of the pastor, it can leave deep wounds. Again, there’s no conspiracy theory needed to explain any of this. In most congregations, the pastor is likely to be one of the newest members, and one with fewer connections than the average member. It’s mighty tempting for churches to solve their problems by canning the pastor, whether formally or behind the scenes, than by dealing with one another. As well, most of the sick puppies understand that pastors have command of the formal structures of the church. They have far more leverage by making him or her unpopular or “controversial.”

Well, no big answers from me. If I had them, do you think I’d know about all of this crap firsthand? But it’s definitely out there and getting worse. There’s something in the culture of the church that’s creating and enabling chronic abuse. I have some ideas about that, but that’s for another time. Meanwhile, pass me that face mask, will you?
