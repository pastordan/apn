Now is the time to wake out of sleep,

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Romans 13:11</span>

↑♫     “O Come O Come Emmanuel”

↑Confession and Forgiveness

Trusting in the God who teaches us the ways of truth, mercy, and righteousness, let us confess our sins and our shortcomings.

*Silent prayer*

Loving God, **we have not prepared ourselves for you. **  
**We have not listened for your arrival,**  
**    we have not trusted in your promises.**  
**Our hearts have not been open to you,**  
**    or to those most in need.**  
**Teach us your steadfast love and faithfulness,**  
**    and make us your people once again.**

The Lord has taken away the judgments against you; he has turned away sin and death. Do not fear and do not let your hands grow weak, for God will renew you in his love. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**

↑♫ Response

*Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;*  
*As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be,*  
*World without end, Amen, Amen.*

Passing the Peace

God will speak peace to his people,  
to those who turn to him in their hearts.

Peace be with you. **And also with you.**

Morning Prayer

The Lord be with you. **And also with you.** Stir up your power, Lord, and come: that, with you as our protector, we may be rescued from our sins; and with you as our deliverer, we may be set free; for you live and reign with God the Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. **Amen.**

Scripture

*Jeremiah 33:14-16*

The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this is the name by which it will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’

Hear what the Spirit is saying to the church!  
**Thanks be to God.**

*Luke 21:25-36*

“There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in a cloud’ with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”

Then he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees; as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

“Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day does not catch you unexpectedly, like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth. Be alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”

This is the holy gospel.  
**Praise to you, Lord Christ.**

Sermon

Communion Service

Take off the garment of your sorrow and affliction, O children of God, and put on forever the beauty of the glory from God. For God will lead Israel with joy, in the light of his glory, with the mercy and righteousness that come from him.

The Lord be with you.  
**And also with you.**

Lift up your hearts.  
**We lift them up to the Lord.**

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.  
**It is right to give him thanks and praise.**

And now we give you thanks, Lord God of Israel and our God, for you have looked favorably upon your people and redeemed them. In Christ Jesus, son of David, you have raised up a mighty savior for us. By your tender mercy, the dawn from on high will break upon us, to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

Therefore, we join our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers, and the multitude of the heavenly host, as we say:

**Glory to God in the highest,**  
**and peace to his people on earth.**

In peace, God our Father and father of our Lord Jesus, hear our prayer: Send your Spirit upon these gifts of bread and wine that our hearts may overflow with your love and so find Jesus near us already in his body and blood.

For we remember that on the night before he died, our brother Jesus took bread, blessed it and broke it, and gave to his friends, saying, Take, eat:

This is my body, broken for you.  
**Do this in remembrance of me.**

In the same way, he also took the cup after supper, saying:

This cup is the new covenant in my blood.  
**Do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.**

Together we celebrate Christ’s presence with us and say:

**We proclaim your death, O Lord;**  
**we confess your resurrection,**  
**we wait for your coming in glory.**  
**May your mercy be upon us all.**

Father, with deep gratitude and thanksgiving we remember the sacrifice of your son on our behalf, his being raised from the tomb, and all the gifts of new life you give to us.

Send now your holy spirit on this bread and this wine, and on all of us who patiently await the coming of your kingdom, to be led by Jesus Christ, the destination of our lives and the fulfillment of all your promises.

Through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all honor and glory are yours, now and forever. **Amen.**

Come, let us receive the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, given for us, and feed on him in our hearts by faith with thanksgiving.

The body of Christ keep you until you see your savior again. **Amen.**  
The blood of Christ keep you until you see your savior again. **Amen.**

*All are welcome at Christ’s family table.*  
*Children may receive communion at their parents’ discretion, *  
*or come forward to receive a blessing.*

O God our joy, our hope, and our consolation: we give you thanks for feeding us at this table. Be mindful of your mercy and of your steadfast love. Remember us, and bring us near to you in the body of your son, Jesus Christ our Lord, now and forever. **Amen.**

↑♫  “This Is The Day the Lord Hath Made”

↑Dismissal

The Lord so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints, and the blessing of God the Father, + the Son, and the Holy Spirit, go with you and remain with you now and always. **Amen.**

Go forth to prepare and to welcome Jesus in your hearts. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**
