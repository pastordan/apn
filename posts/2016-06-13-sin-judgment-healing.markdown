I usually post my sermon texts here straight from the file, but I think Dropbox might not be syncing between my office and home.

Fortunately, as you will see, I decided to give Twitter a preview of today's sermon. I've also appended a few thoughts on sin and mental illness, in response to a question, and a different angle on the story of Jesus healing an unnamed woman who washes his feet with her tears, in light of this morning's horrific news from Orlando.
