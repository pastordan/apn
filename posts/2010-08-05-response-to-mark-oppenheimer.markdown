[Mark Oppenheimer](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/aug/05/changing-the-script-daniel-schultz) thinks [*Changing the Script*](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Script-Authentically-Progressive-Political/dp/1935439146) plays true to type. I’ll return the favor: his review of the book is stereotypical of elite opinion-makers: tendentious, filled with an ideological axe to grind and an inability to see the forest for the trees.

Oppenheimer’s main critique of the book is that it doesn’t address the history of liberal Christianity to his satisfaction. Well, no, a *theological* work devoted to fostering a *new* critical discourse for contemporary politics probably isn’t going to spend an awful lot of time on the historical development of a very large and rather inchoate movement. I suppose that I could have included a historical overview, but it’s been done before by, among others, Amy Sullivan, E.J. Dionne, Jim Wallis, and Paul Raushenbush in his edited reissue of his great-grandfather’s *Christianity and the Social Crisis*. The history also seemed frankly like something of a tangent, so I skipped it. That may have been a mistake, as Oppenheimer says. (It may interest him to know, though, that I have degrees in history and the history of thought.)

But even by his own standards, Oppenheimer’s critique falls flat. Among the things he doesn’t mention:

- The evangelicals who led the abolition and prohibition movements were generally members of today’s mainline denominations;

- That mainline Protestants have been the people keeping the Social Gospel program alive for most of the past century, with it only being recently re-discovered by evangelicals;

- That despite their affinity for social justice, mainliners (and to some extent Catholics) have been heirs to Reinhold Niebuhr’s critique of the Social Gospel, and therefore have shied away from attempting to establish the Kingdom of God through governmental means;

- That it was *mainline* denominations that funded the Civil Rights movement and provided important logistical support so that the black churches could carry out their work. Meanwhile, white evangelical groups like the Southern Baptist Convention sat on their hands;

- That white evangelicals, according to the historian Randall Balmer, didn’t enter politics in response to abortion, but in opposition to the Carter administration’s challenge of tax-exempt, racially-segregated Christian schools– notably Bob Jones University.  Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority, which emphasized abortion as an issue, was not even founded until 1979;

- That, in the words of my friend and colleague Frederick Clarkson, social issues were a factor in the development of the modern Religious Right, but “but mass political behavior does not change in response to such issues alone. Openheimer ignores the tremendous changes going on in evangelical theology, led by influential conservative Reformed Presbyterian  theologians Frances Schaeffer and R.J. Rushdoony whose work argued with pietism and pointed conservative evangelicals away from apolitical pietism and directly towards political confrontation and acquisition of political and governmental power.  Add this necessary prerequisite to the the ongoing efforts of political operatives and power brokers to organize the discontent of white conservative Christians on a host of matters, including and especially race (Southern strategy, anyone?) into a more cohesive political formation and out of the Democratic Party, and you get the modern Religious Right.”

If it seems like I’m harping on mainline Protestants here, I am. Oppenheimer is curiously focused on the evangelical role in the religious left, as if there were no other players in the movement. More serious, perhaps, is that Oppenheimer ends his historical analysis in 1980. In the meantime, we’ve seen the mainline denominations attacked as instruments of Communism, divided by right-wing operatives around manufactured controversies about gay rights and abortion, and dealing with their own loss of market share in a shrinking religious economy.

And since 1994, religious liberals have been hit over the head time and again with appeals to make nice with cultural conservatives, to find “common ground” and increase “civil discourse” in order to “transform politics.” If Oppenheimer doesn’t understand how powerful the drive for reconciliation is in some corners of the religious left (Amy Sullivan, E.J. Dionne, Jim Wallis, Barack Obama), and how that sometimes prevents the formation of an intelligible systemic critique of our present situation, he doesn’t deserve his seat at the *New York Times*.

He does get some things right. I’ll stipulate that the weakest part of *Changing the Script* is in supplying sample prophetic language. I’m not entirely sure why he thinks I should have used the Exodus narrative, though, since it’s mentioned often in the section on the economy. Perhaps I should develop that line of thought, though customarily, reviewers will say “I look forward to seeing how this first-time author expands on these ideas…” rather than summarily dismissing their thoughts.

The other thing Oppenheimer gets right: the United Church of Christ is indeed “a denomination descended *in part* from the English Puritans who settled in Massachusetts” (my emphasis). It always bothers me when the German heritage of the UCC is overlooked in favor of Congregationalism. It’s a pet peeve I share with Walter Brueggemann.
