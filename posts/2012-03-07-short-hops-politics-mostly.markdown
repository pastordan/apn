- [An extraordinarily firm statement from a judge on Wisconsin’s new voter ID law.](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/judge-grants-temporarily-injunction-barring-enforcement-of-voter-id-law/article_82e53b00-67c1-11e1-8ab3-0019bb2963f4.html)
- Many of my friends from Madison will remember the very odd case of a [transvestite whose skeleton was found stuffed down the chimney of a music store back in 1989](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime_and_courts/case-of-mysterious-chimney-skeleton-may-have-fresh-clue/article_56cdd86e-64b1-11e1-ba77-001871e3ce6c.html). Come to think of it, many of my enemies will remember it too.
- I often say that I was a punk long before I was a pastor. [Seems this guy was too.](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2012%2F03%2F02%2FDDCR1N1UJ4.DTL) We’re out there.
- This post is fun not least because it uses the phrase [Cum hoc ergo propter hoc](http://dmergent.org/2012/03/05/fighting-the-last-war-churches-with-bad-habits/) in regards to church wars.
- My, my. [An evangelical megachurch in Colorado Springs splitting from a mainline denomination](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jvtib-oPnXFHmp030dzJYWI6gk9A?docId=708d68d310c0412c93a9581a8ca83c86). Such a surprise.
- A [proposed covenant for behavior in the Anglican communion](http://www.episcopalcafe.com/lead/church_of_england/two_english_bishops_wring_thei.html) is running into a hard time. It seems that the Anglicans don’t really want it, is the trouble. But it gives us the opportunity to announce that [Sodor and Man voted against it ](http://www.episcopalcafe.com/lead/anglican_covenant/covenant_having_a_bad_weekend.html)this weekend. Isn’t Sodor where Thomas the Tank Engine is from?
- [Native tribes in Wisconsin are opposing proposed mining legislation](http://www.dailyyonder.com/change-mining-regs-faces-tribal-opposition/2012/03/01/3794). At the moment, [the bill appears to be dead](http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20120306/APC010401/203060441), though.
