Prayer of Confession (Based on [Psalm 14](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=300281442))

Friends, only foolish people say “We have done nothing wrong; no one cares what we do.” Let us confess our sins and shortcomings, and seek to walk in God’s paths.

God of goodness and justice, **we confess that we have gone astray, that we do the wrong thing even when we know we shouldn’t. Teach us to do better. Give us the strength not to fear you, but to do what is right and to stand up for those who have no one to protect them. Amen.**

*Silent prayer*

The Lord watches over the people of God, and will deliver them from all evil. Rejoice and be glad, for you have been saved from the power of sin, and forgiven for all you have done wrong. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**

*Gloria Patri*

We were made to be signs of God’s peace in the world. Let us share that sign with one another, saying, Peace be with you. **And also with you.**

 

Prayer of Confession (Based on [Psalm 51](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=300281663))

Let us pray that God might cleanse our guilt and pardon our sins.

*Silent prayer*

Have mercy on us, O God, **according to your steadfast love. By your abundant mercy take away all the things we have done wrong. Wash away our wickedness and cleanse us from our sin.**

Create in us clean hearts, O God, **and put a new and steadfast spirit within us.**

Restore us to the joy of your salvation, **and sustain in us a spirit willing to do what is right.**

For we pray to you in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, who died that we might freed and restored. **Amen.**

Our sacrifice is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart God will not despise. Our sins are forgiven, and we are free to live [add a topical petition here]. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**
