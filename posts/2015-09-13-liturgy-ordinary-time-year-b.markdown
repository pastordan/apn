**who walk in the law of the Lord.**

Happy are those who keep God’s decrees,

“You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,” says the Lord our God. Therefore, let us praise God, who has dealt wondrously with us. **Amen. Thanks be to God!**

Great Prayer

The Lord be with you.  
**And also with you.**

Lift up your hearts.  
**We lift them up to the Lord.**

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.  
**He alone is worthy of our praise.**

It is right to give you thanks and praise, God our Father. Through you and your generous creation, the fields and pastures are green; the trees bear fruit, and the vines give their full yield. Through you the barns are full and our cups overflow with the plenty you have given us.

In your Son Jesus Christ, you have made it possible for us to turn away from our sins and be saved. In him, you welcome all people, the least and the humblest first, the strong and the proud last, even us, whose hearts yearn to be created anew in his image.

In your Holy Spirit, you have given us the wisdom to see the heavens tell of your glory and of your love for us. In the Spirit you renew all things and pass into holy souls to make them your friends.

In gratitude for your work in creation and in the human heart, with the faithful in every time and age and with all the heavenly host, we praise your name and sing in adoration:

♫*Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,*  
*All your works shall praise your name on earth and sky and sea;*  
*Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,*  
*God in three persons, blessed Trinity.*

God of earth and sky and sea, most tender God who loves us like father and mother, send your Holy Spirit on us and on these gifts of bread and wine that they may be for us the body and blood of Christ, who…

Words of Institution

On the night before he gave himself up to humility and death, took bread and gave you thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying: “Take, eat. This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”

In the same way, he also took the cup, gave you thanks and gave it to them, saying: “Drink this, all of you; this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”

Therefore, let us proclaim the mystery of faith:

**Christ has died.**  
**Christ is risen.**  
**Christ will come again.**

Send your Holy Spirit upon us and upon these our gifts, so that we, when we eat this bread and drink this wine, may receive our Lord Jesus Christ. **Amen.**

Distribution of the Elements

Blessed be God who feeds all people.  
**Blessed be God who makes new all creation.**

Come, for you are invited to eat with Jesus at his table.

The body of Christ, that is given for you. Take and eat.

The blood of Christ, that is shed for you. Take and drink.

Prayer after Communion

Let us give thanks for the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. **Amen.**

Christ Jesus, bread of heaven, **you heal us, you accept us, you feed us in our need. Now show your love to the world through us and make it new once more. Amen.**

Dismissal

God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn it, but in order that the world might be saved through him.

Go forth with the blessing of God the Father, + the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with open hearts and with the freedom to love and to serve. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**

 

*Or: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who will be</span> with us in truth and love. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**
