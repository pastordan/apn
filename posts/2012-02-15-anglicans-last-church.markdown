Judging by people’s reactions in the comments, I didn’t make my point clearly enough in last night’s post. So let me take one more hack at it and then we’re done.

Yes, Anglican worship is beautiful and timeless. No, the liturgy itself doesn’t mandate fussiness in the conduct of worship. Yes, Rite II is easier to follow than Rite I. Yes, some people are attracted to Anglican-style liturgical worship. All of this is very true, and I’m glad that people love or are drawn in by this style of worship. I like it too, at least sometimes.

But my point isn’t about the people who *are* in TEC. It’s about the people who *aren’t*. Sure, I’m glad you love the worship. That’s great. But for every one person who loves it, how many hate it, or are put off by it, or who are simply looking for something else? I have a congregation full of people who left the Catholic church, mostly because they married a Protestant. Yet and still, they get a little squirrelly every time worship gets a little too “Catholic.” They feel like having a set liturgy makes things too “rote.” About how many former Episcopalians could we say the same thing? How many people might otherwise consider a TEC congregation and think twice because of the high church style?

As I said in the comments, I mean to be critical but non-judgmental. Going from thinking about the people in your pews and what they want and need to thinking about the people who *aren’t*, and what they might want and need, is a very difficult conceptual shift to make. I don’t know that I’m particularly successful with it in my own situation.

And let’s be clear: this is a situation that all churches face in one way or another. I don’t know how many people the liturgy keeps away from TEC, and I’m certainly not proposing that Anglicans suddenly embrace Willow-Creek-seeker-style worship models. That’s not who most Anglicans or Episcopalians are. But that’s the entire problem: *who Anglicans are* isn’t a hugely popular identity, despite Hollywood’s persistence in seeing every non-snake-handling church as Anglican. If Anglicanism (or Methodism, or Lutheranism, or whatever it is that UCC’ers are) were wildly popular, there would be no problem filling the pews. So it’s a damnable thing, but the truth is probably that exactly those things who make us who we are, and exactly those things that we love about ourselves, keep at least some people from joining our communities.

We go through this in the UCC in a different way. We’re focused on radical inclusiveness, welcoming people who have been unwelcome in other traditions. That’s great. It works really well in some settings. In other settings, not so much. There are any number of conservative and/or Evangelicals with deep roots in the UCC who simply aren’t able to hang with that inclusiveness, and so they’ve left. I wish them well. They don’t need to persist in a denomination where they’re uncomfortable and where they make others uncomfortable. Paradoxically, our core value of inclusiveness winds up excluding some folks. I wouldn’t want to give that value up for anything, but it’s important to recognize that there is some cost to it.

What I am suggesting, then, is that TEC may need to dust off its core values, core pieces of identity, and see how well they’re working. Perhaps they’re doing just fine, and it’s simply a matter of figuring out a new way to package them. Perhaps some of them will need to be modified, upheld in a different way, or dropped altogether. Or maybe Episcopalians will just have to stick to their guns and accept that they’re going to be a small communion from now on. All I’m saying is that when you’re in an existential crisis, don’t look at the peripheral stuff. Look right at the center of who you are and what you do. That’s where the action is, for better or worse.

*To be very clear, I don’t mean Anglicans should take the hindmost, but that this is hopefully the last post I’ll have to do on them for a while. I’ve had it up to *here* with the clerical collars.
