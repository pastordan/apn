Via [Digby](http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/principles-and-priorities-accepting.html), a report from [Fox11 in Green Bay](http://www.fox11online.com/dpp/news/local/green_bay/pantry-turns-down-planned-parenthood):

> An area Catholic food pantry whose mission is to feed the hungry says no to Planned Parenthood.
> 
> As part of its Martin Luther King food drive, Planned Parenthood collected 50 pounds of food. It hoped to donate the food to Paul’s Pantry.
> 
> “What was told to me was that they simply said we do not want any food donations from you period,” said Lisa Boyce, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.
> 
> Boyce says Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin started the annual January food drive two years ago in Milwaukee. Boyce says this year the food drive expanded to centers across the state. She says Paul’s Pantry was supposed to pickup the Green Bay collections, but it never happened.
> 
> “We simply called there to offer to drop the food off,” said Boyce. “At that time we were told they did not want our food donations.”

Oh for the love of Mike. What is wrong with some people? Well, we’re just down the road from De Pere, and our community pantry *always* needs donations. We’ll take the food, if I have to drive there and get it myself.
