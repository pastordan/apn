There’s a smashing [interview with John Nichols up at AlterNet](http://www.alternet.org/story/154223/how_the_wisconsin_uprising_changed_america_and_why_its_renegade_politics_are_here_to_stay/?page=entire) today. (Since yesterday, actually.) Nichols thinks the recall against Gov. Scott Walker will succeed:

> Now, the other thing too about the Walker recall, and this is a practical reality of why I think it will probably succeed, is that while we care very much about these labor issues, and these popular democracy issues, corrupt corporate power tends to be corrupt. Walker is the subject of a John Doe investigation in Wisconsin that continues to reveal increasing amounts of illegal activity by his aides. The revelations are devastating politically to him. I’ve seen the polling that suggests that it really moves numbers even among moderate Republicans.

That jibes with some numbers from a [Marquette University poll](http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/139960443.html) out this morning:

> Wisconsinites are evenly divided over Gov. Scott Walker’s job performance, with 47% approving and 47% disapproving. Walker is viewed favorably by 46% of registered voters and unfavorably by 48%. Those numbers are slightly worse than in a similar survey done by Marquette a month ago, when 50% viewed him favorably and 45% viewed him unfavorably. But the differences are within the poll’s margin of error of 3.7 percentage points.

Marquette didn’t directly poll Walker’s re-elect numbers. But his approval rating has to be worrying his team. There aren’t many people in the middle, and like Nichols says, the continuing John Doe probe isn’t exactly going to convince people to side with him. The more ‘Sconnies think he’s sold them out to corporate power, the more trouble he’s in. Personally, I agree with Nichols. The dynamics of this race aren’t in Walker’s favor. Unless he can do something to change the situation in a big way, he’s done.

Also from that poll: Pres. Obama leads every potential Republican opponent by double digits. He absolutely creams Romney, Gingrich and Ron Paul. Santorum’s a little closer, but not much. Tammy Baldwin is behind Tommy Thompson, but leads the other GOP candidates by a decent margin. A lot of Thompson’s lead is probably down to his name recognition, and the better Obama does in the state, the better Baldwin will do. If Baldwin and Thompson square off, look for his lead to vanish quickly.

Nichols said something else in the interview that’s worth mentioning:

> So my sense is that the Walker recall will succeed in part because Walker will be in a lot of trouble. But it must succeed as a popular movement that isn’t just about money and politics, it’s got to be real and it’s got to have something to it that excites people because politics shouldn’t be a boring spectator sport.

This too is true. Nichols points to the solidarity demonstrated by the various public unions, who refused to be split from one another in Walker’s divide-and-conquer operation. As well, the outpouring of public support at the Capitol was dramatic, almost cinematic. There really is no replacement for people physically going down to a protest and being present with fellow citizens. It creates interhuman and social bonds that cannot be made any other way. Obama cruised to victory in 2008 in large part by creating a movement based on a vision of a society not driven by corporate power and greed. He’s never really put the network he built to use the way it should have been, but it gave people ideas about what they could do if they set their minds to it. In Wisconsin, Ohio, and many other places, people are starting to wake up to the power of populist progressivism.

Like Nichols says, their leaders ought to pay attention and follow the people’s lead. If they do, the results could be nothing less than spectacular, even compared to what we’ve seen so far. He’s hopeful if tentative. Let the rest of us hope he’s right. The alternative is grim, to say the least.
