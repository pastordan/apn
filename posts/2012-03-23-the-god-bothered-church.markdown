This quote from Walter Brueggemann, found in Elizabeth F. Caldwell’s *Making a Home For Faith*, is more relevant to my interests than I can begin to explain:

> The life of Christian faith is a life of profound bother. It is centered in the awareness that there is an incongruity between what is and what God has intended.

The times when I have felt authentically called or led by God have very seldom felt like happy, exciting news. Mostly, they fall into the category of “this will be a gigantic pain in the ass, but it’s the right thing to do.”

I was just turning that thought over in regards to last night’s post about wanting to do more liturgical writing. The *bother* was missing from the emerging call, which made me a bit dubious about it. But reading Caldwell’s exploration of what it takes *in adults* to help them form the faith of children brings the bother in a hurry. If the church—my church, any church—is going to do an effective job of helping children discover their faith, it will have to re-write the way it does worship with kids.

I mean that last bit literally: that’s where my call meets the needs of the church. I don’t want to do it. It’s going to be a huge pain in the ass. But it is absolutely, entirely, completely necessary.

And just to rub salt into the wound, this rewriting has to take place in the context of adults who want nothing more than to be confirmed in their faith from Sunday to Sunday, to be reassured and relieved of the anxiety of noticing the incongruity between what is and what God has intended. Shaping the faith of children is a bother not least because it requires *adults* to figure out what they believe and act like it. To some extent, that tension is natural—the needs of children and their grandparents are often very different—but to some extent, it’s caused by the simple damn spiritual laziness every pastor knows is present in some or all of their members.

This isn’t to point fingers, only to say that we are at a point in our culture where sustaining the faith into the next generation or two will take some effort, from pastors and laity alike. It’s going to be a bother, but it is the right thing to do. Which means, dang it, that it’s probably a legitimate call. Stay tuned.
