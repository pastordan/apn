I make fun of a lot of stuff that comes across the Christian Newswire because, to be honest, a lot of it is [just plain nuts](http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/its-not-just-pepsi-drug-food-cosmetic-companies-use-aborted-baby-cells-says). But I have to say this seems like [a pretty good idea](http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/2515319150.html):

> A growing number of churches in the U.S. are turning to an innovative training program to equip their congregations with the skills to recognize mental illness and respond to mental health emergencies. The program, Mental Health First Aid, helps people assess a mental health crisis, select interventions and provide initial help.  ”The faith community has always felt a calling to help people, but has not always had the tools to assist people struggling with conditions like depression,” says Mike Johnson, an instructor and special projects director at Union Gospel Mission in Seattle. “Shortly after our first training, we realized that this was a resource the faith community had been missing.”

And this part is good to hear:

> Mental Health First Aid is an evidence-based program, which uses role-playing and simulations to demonstrate how to assess a mental health crisis, select interventions and provide initial help. The training also addresses the risk factors and warning signs of specific illnesses like anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and substance use disorders.

I think I’ll check this out for my own congregation. This part makes me wince a little, though:

> “Many times people of faith respond to someone with mental illness by saying ‘I’m praying about it,’ but now they can do something about it,” says Vogt, former chair of the Georgia Suicide Prevention Coalition. “I compare it to seeing a child get hit by a car. You pray, but you also call 911.”
