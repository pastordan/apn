If you’re like me, you’ve probably said to yourself, “I worry about how I would celebrate in liturgy the 50th Anniversary of the founding of an Association in the United Church of Christ. Specifically, I worry about how I might wrap that celebration into a day-long business meeting of said Association!”*

Well, worry no more. Here–available for the first time anywhere–is [the liturgy for the Southeast Wisconsin Association Meeting 2012](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ofz9kn0ana1qhou/SE%20Association%20Meeting%202012p.pdf), on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary. And just so you don’t fret about how such a bulletin might be presented to the congregation, here is [the bulletin](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7sy19xmbbkv4wyh/SEWA%20Jubilee%20Bulletin.pdf) handed out at the meeting. I don’t actually know how it went over: I had to skip the meeting in order to stand in freezing rain and sleet at my son’s soccer game.

*No, nobody actually asks themselves such questions, not even myself. It’s more like somebody calls you up and says, “We need a worship service centered on covenant and jubilee, based on this ridiculously obscure scripture passage, and don’t forget room for announcements and bathroom breaks.” And you answer the summons, for whatever reason. You should probably work on that.
