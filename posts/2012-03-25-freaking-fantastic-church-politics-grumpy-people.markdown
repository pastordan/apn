As some of you know, Wisconsin State Senator Glen Grothmann often makes an appearance at my church’s annual pancake breakfast. I do my Christian duty and play good host without confronting him, or F. James Sensenbrenner, when he comes.

But somebody just teased me with a truly horrible thought. Rumor has it that Grothmann is at a private event with Rick Santorum, who’s barnstorming through Wisconsin this weekend. Santorum will be campaigning in Fond du Lac tomorrow afternoon, about 20-25 miles from us. What if Grothmann brought his new pal with him to breakfast tomorrow?

For once, I might win the “Grumpiest Man at Salem” award. It’s entirely possible in such a scenario that I might actually have to leave so as not to say something inappropriate or have a stroke or some combination of the two.

Gah.
