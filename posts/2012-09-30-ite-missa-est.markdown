Below the fold, you will find the text of my last sermon for Salem church. I daresay it was one of my better ones. You can judge for yourself.

As many as ten of you are probably eager to know how things went. The answer is, they went fine. I did not ascend the steps to the high altar [singing “My Way” and gunning down the audience with a revolver](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDyb_alTkMQ). Neither did they take any pot shots at me, though. Nobody came to gloat.

I was in fine voice this morning, both in preaching and prayers. One little boy was dressed to the nines, in a tuxedo vest and bow tie, and as I discovered later, with a matching top hat too. Another was miming along with during the great dialogue. I told him after church he could grow up to be a pastor if he wanted. The crazy old man who’s killing the church had to let everyone know how wonderful the Sunday School pizza night was on Thursday. “I’ve never seen the children so happy in all my time here. We hope all the kids who were there will come back for Sunday School,” he crowed. “And if they don’t, that’s okay, we’ll go get some more.”

“I think that was overstated,” another member told me after worship.

During the communion service, my sleeve caught the little cross on the lid to the tray of wine and juice glasses. I managed to shake it up pretty good, spilling the contents all over the inside of the tray. Thirteen years of ordained ministry, and that’s the first time I’ve done anything like that.

A couple of people teared up during the service. We were happy to have our good friends the Kemps with us for support and buffering. After church, Carl gave them “sweaty Tootsie Rolls” from his pocket. At the door, many people thanked me for the six years I’d been there and wished us well on our way. They’re happy to know that I seem to be headed into teaching. They think it will be a good fit for me. It probably will.

It was a bit odd to stand behind the table and realize that it was probably the last time I would do so, and sad to think about things coming to an end. But I tried not to let myself go down that path. Things worked out the way they did, and now it’s time for something new. Perhaps I’m just numb out of self-defense, or perhaps I’ve done all my grieving and saying goodbye already. Whatever the case, I’m sad for some of the members of the church who know they’ve lost an effective pastor, and for those who know they’ve lost one who really cared about them. People ask what will become of the church, and I have to say I just don’t know. The most likely scenario is that it will become a “zombie church,” alive in name only, drifting along ever smaller for who knows how long. Maybe it will flourish, maybe it will die. I just don’t know.

Anyway, I’m sad for the people who know this is a loss. But I’m not sad for myself, nor should you be. That chapter of my life has come to an end, and now it’s time to look for and embrace such newness as comes our way. We’ll let you know about it when we do.

Oh, **Pee Ess**: After church, we went over to the Kemps’ for brunch. On the way, I passed by a truck carrying an animal on a rear-mounted rack. I actually had to circle around and come to make sure I saw what I thought I did. Sure enough, it was a bear, about 250 pounds, harvested in Marinette County. The guy told me he wasn’t sure if he’d have it stuffed or turned into a rug.

<div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">**[2 Corinthians 13:11-14](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=216034768)**</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Well, my friends, the end is finally here. I can’t pretend to be happy about it. My departure seems by turns stupid, sad, unnecessary and counterproductive. Yet by the same token, I can’t pretend to be *unhappy* about the situation either. It’s not that I won’t be sad to say goodbye. I will. At the same time, though, my family and I have begun already a new chapter in our lives, and try as I might, I can’t help being happy to do so.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I stopped by the parsonage yesterday to sweep off the porch and pick up the last of our things. As I took one last look around the house, it was sad to see it empty and cold. Everything echoes in that house now, and without air constantly circulating, the musty basement smell is starting to take over. But as I looked into my bedroom, I tried to imagine our bed back where it used to be, what it would be like if we were suddenly returned to the house. I realized I couldn’t imagine such a thing any longer. We invest our dwelling places with the feeling of home surprisingly quickly, and just as quickly, the investment is removed.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">After only a week away, I have a home, but it’s not across the parking lot. It’s an apartment in Fond du Lac.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">And I have a ministry, but it’s not here. It’s at Lakeland and Marian.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I am not grieving the situation, and I am certainly not shaking a finger at anyone about it. It simply is. Were someone to come up with a million dollars for me to return to Wayne and take up residency as your pastor again, I would have to decline, graciously, perhaps with a few regrets, but firmly. The call has ended, and as soon as the mass has been said, I will no longer be your pastor.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">It took me a long time to put together this morning’s worship service. I kept looking at various farewell liturgies, and they were all dreadful. Finally I realized that what needed to be said could be in the end of Paul’s letter to one of his more challenging congregations, with whom he had a very difficult relationship, and in the words of the communion liturgy.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Paul says to the church in Corinth, “Finally, brothers and sisters, farewell.” This was standard closing language for a letter in Paul’s day. As one of my commentaries puts it, it strikes with all the force of “Sincerely yours.” But that word “farewell” also means “rejoice, be happy.” And I agree: while it is sad to sad goodbye, I want you all to rejoice and be happy at this moment. Not because I’m leaving, but because with every end there comes an opportunity for new life to begin. It is not for me to say if my departure will be the end that you finally need to bring something new to this congregation, or if Salem itself will have to die in order that there may be new life. But today is an end, and in every end, God makes a promise of newness. You should greet that promise with joy, and pray very hard that it be fulfilled. In that light: indeed, farewell, rejoice.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">“Put things in order,” Paul says, which we could also translate “mend your ways,” or as the Common English Version has it, “Do better!” This doesn’t come out of nowhere: Paul has spent the better part of twenty-eight chapters across two letters trying to get the Corinthians to shape up. He is on his way to visit them in person to resolve some of the problems they’ve been having. Ahead of his arrival, he sends them this letter with a few instructions and this urging to do what he’s been telling them all this time. *Don’t just say you’re going to do it,* Paul is telling them. *Actually do it.* Even better, it could be that he’s telling them “may your ways be mended,” that is, “may God help you do better.” Or he could be saying “mend *one another’s* ways,” in the mutual upbuilding Paul is well-known for calling upon his churches to engage in.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">However you interpret it, this phrase makes a satisfying prayer. This church has problems. You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it. All churches do. Because I will no longer be here to help you with those problems, I pray both that God will help you to resolve them, and that you help one another to resolve them.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">“Listen to my appeal,” Paul says, which might mean “encourage one another,” or which might be one last pitch for the collection he’s taking up for the poor in Jerusalem. Again, either way, it makes a fine prayer. You should encourage one another, and when Sherry comes around asking for donations to CROP, you should give generously.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Likewise, “agree with one another” and “live in peace.” This congregation has been divided in disagreement for far too long. I once asked the Consistory if they could remember a time when everyone got along, and the answer was no, as far back as we can remember, people have been fighting about money and the minister. I tried my best to heal those self-inflicted wounds, but evidently I have failed. It’s up to you now. No pastor can make you agree with one another, or live in peace, no matter how talented or well-liked he or she may be. You will have to decide whether you can come to unity or if you will need to walk away from one another. All I can or will say is: choose one path or the other. By all means, agree with one another, and live in peace. But if you can’t, don’t pretend that you can. Split graciously so that you can find agreement and peace elsewhere, if not here. Limping along and pretending that you all get along just fine hasn’t done anyone any favors.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">There I go again. My vocation is and always has been in some ways to be a teacher. I can’t resist it, even when there is other, urgent business to attend to. The business here is saying goodbye, and I shall return to it. Now, even.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 6.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">You may recognize the conclusion of this morning’s lesson as the greeting we very commonly use at the start of worship:</span></div>> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.</span>

<div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Sometimes, as it is in this morning’s bulletin, that’s translated as “the *fellowship* of the Holy Spirit.” The word is *koinonia*, community. But I like the play on the word communion, because as I have preached any number of times, at the Lord’s table, we are bound together in a new and radical kind of community, different from yet embedded in everything else we know in the world around us. The eucharist is the glue that binds the church together and the invisible web that connects us across time and space to all Christians everywhere, past, present and future. In baptism, we are made the Lord’s, and in communion, we are reminded that he is with us, even until the end of time. God is with us and God is for us, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 20.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"></span></div><div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 6.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Therefore, I want to end today’s worship service with the same blessing with which it began, as a way of reminding all of us of God’s constant, connecting presence. You may be overjoyed that I am leaving this community. You may be heartbroken. But these words are true:</span></div>> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">The bread we break is a sharing in the body of Christ.</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">We who are many are one body, for we all share the one bread.</span>

<div style="font: 16.0px Palatino; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Though my ministry with you is done, I will still be with you in the body of Christ, now and always. Try as I might, I can think of no better way than that to say goodbye. Amen.</span></div>
