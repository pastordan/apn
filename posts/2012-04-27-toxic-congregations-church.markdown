I wrote about this study of [“toxic congregations”](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-briggs/silent-clergy-killers-tox_b_1437857.html) from the Review of Religious Research the other day ([“Who Bothers to Kill the Clergy Softly?”](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/2012/03/21/who-bothers-to-kill-the-clergy-softly-church/)), but here it is again, with a bit more detail:

> An online study published in the March issue of the Review of Religious Research found 28 percent of ministers said they had at one time been forced to leave their jobs due to personal attacks and criticism from a small faction of their congregations.
> 
> The researchers from Texas Tech University and Virginia Tech University also found that the clergy who had been forced out were more likely to report lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of depression, stress and physical health problems.

Can’t seem to find the methodology, but generally speaking, online polls are suspect. The samples aren’t truly random. Don’t doubt for a minute, however, that this is a problem. It is.

They say that a small slice of congregations are responsible for a lot of the carnage: according to one study 7% of churches cause 35% of the conflict. That makes sense in a couple of different ways. Not many congregations have the necessary features to allow themselves to be held captive by a small group of members. My guess is that a study of that 7% of churches would come up with one or more of the following characteristics: small and/or small leadership group (10 people threatening to leave a 500 member church just isn’t much of a threat), high levels of anxiety in the community, poor or weak leadership, poor or weak sense of direction of the community, and a low tolerance for conflict. If I had more brains or initiative, I’d set up a survey to test that theory and use the results for a Doctor of Ministry thesis.

Anyway, the “repeat offenders” theory also makes sense in that the conditions needed to produce this conflict also inhibit learning from experience. That lack of learning is made worse by a number of factors. There are conflict-averse clergy who would rather simply melt away than help their congregations learn from their mistakes. (To put that more sympathetically, by the time they leave, many pastors are so beaten down they can’t provide any assistance in an exit interview.) There are the judicatory members who can’t or won’t do anything more than bury the conflict and hope things go better with the next guy. Interim ministers help, but there’s only so much they can do, and congregations become very good at hiding the dirty laundry until the settled pastor arrives. And last but not least, there really are some sick puppies out there who run a pastor out of a congregation, decide it’s fun, and do it some more. Calling these people “bullies” might sound like it’s minimizing the problem, but it’s basically the same process you see on the school playground. Some people feel empowered when they can push somebody else around, and the church provides them with precious little resistance when they do it.

Don’t get me started.

It gets difficult to pin some of this stuff down, says Mark Tanner, one of the researchers:

> Many churches do not keep records indicating when a pastor was forced out as opposed to leaving voluntarily. And not only is it difficult to get clergy to open up about such painful experiences, many ministers are forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement to receive their severance package.

In many cases, it’s not even clear that the pastor *is* being forced out. If you’re frustrated with the local pinheads and a wonderful opportunity in a larger congregation near your mom’s house pops up, is that being forced out? Depends on who you ask.

This part is clear and, I’m afraid, quite accurate:

> Ministers who were forced out of their jobs because of congregational conflict were more likely to experience burnout, depression, lower self-esteem and more physical health problems, the online study found.
> 
> In addition, more than four in 10 ministers forced out of their jobs reported seriously considering leaving the ministry.
> 
> …
> 
> Months of suffering traumatic and demeaning psychological and emotional abuse as they are slowly being forced out of their pulpits due to congregational conflict, Tanner said, “is a really, really horrible process.”

Yes it is.
