title: Some Days You Just Have To Say "I Haven't Seen That Mouse Lately" [Church]

This here post on [ministry being a rat race (literally)](http://www.abpnews.com/content/view/7323/9/) is dead-on. Interruptions always come, they’re always at the worst moment, and they’re always about the stupidest stuff you can imagine. Ms. Butler should be grateful that she wasn’t dealing with a couple of dyed-in-the-wool animal lovers.

Which brings to mind a brilliant piece of advice once given to me by a colleague. She told of a mouse who had taken up residence in the church kitchen, chewing and rooting and doing what mice will do when left unsupervised. This seems like a simple problem with a simple solution, except for the animal lovers, who wouldn’t want to harm one of God’s beloved creatures.

So, the advice went, sometimes you have to do what needs to be done and say “Why no, I haven’t seen that mouse lately.” And that’s ministry some days.
