<em>Bumping this up as something of a tradition.</em>

I have a reputation as a baker. Funny how that happens: first you tell people “Hey, I like to bake.” Then you show up with a loaf or two of bread under your arm, and all of a sudden people start to take you seriously. Or something like that.

Anyway, having the reputation leads to certain obligations. For example: just about every year at this time, I am asked to provide dinner rolls for family gatherings. It only took two or three years of volunteering to get the job. My go-to recipe has been what my grandmother called “refrigerator rolls” or “butterhorns.” They’ve long been a staple at my family gatherings, and now I’m exporting them to friends and the next generation of Schultzes, et. al. If you see me walking in with a bunch of them, there’s a good chance you’re going home with some of them. Tag, hope you took your insulin.

The recipe really did originate with Grandma Warming, though it’s a standard enough formula that I suspect she got from a cookbook or Lady’s Home Journal. As something of a belated Thanksgiving present—and because I wanted to update the recipe—I’ll pass it along. It’s a good place to start for a beginning baker: the recipe is very forgiving, and even if you screw it up a little, your victims will slather them with so much butter and or jam that they’ll hardly notice.

I typically make a double batch. If your family gathering isn’t so big, you can cut the following measurements in half:

> 1 1/2 c. milk   
> 1 c. sugar   
> 2 t. salt   
> 1 c. butter

Warm the milk to about 100°, just a little warmer than the proverbial baby’s bathwater. Melt the butter and mix it in, along with the sugar and salt. Don’t skimp on the sugar—the dough will need it for its time in the fridge.

> 1/2 c. warm water   
> 2 T. yeast

Mix together and set aside. Add a pinch of sugar if you’re not sure about your yeast. When it’s foamy, combine with liquid ingredients above and add in:

> 2 eggs

You can beat them before or while you’re mixing—it doesn’t make much difference.

Combine all of this with:

8-10 c. white flour
It sounds stupid, but it’s really true: good flour makes a difference. I use King Arthur, but there are plenty of other good brands available. You could substitute two or three cups of whole wheat flour for white, if you’re into that kind of thing. Personally, I don’t swing that way, but if you do, increase the liquid content somewhat, perhaps another 1/4 cup of milk.

I usually stick all of this in our stand mixer for a few minutes with the paddle, but you could also use a wooden spoon if you want to kick it old school. I tend to use on the lower end of the range: the final result should be smooth, firm, and substantial, but not dry. Less flour makes for rolls that are light and a bit dry, more gives you solid and chewy. ‘Sup to you.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 3 days. I use a glass bowl with a plastic lid, but Tupperware will work just fine. The dough will expand some, but not a lot. The longer you keep it in the fridge, the more time it will have to develop flavor and texture.

When you’re ready to bake, pull half the dough out and let it warm up for about an hour. Cut it into thirds, then roll into circles between 10″-12″ in diameter. Mom and Grandma always brushed the dough with melted butter at this point, but I’ve found it makes it difficult to work with. In particular, the dough doesn’t want to keep that classic butterhorn shape. I skip this step, and find there’s no loss to the taste, but your mileage may vary. In any case, cut the circles into 8 wedges and roll them up, starting on the base.

Let rise for an hour or a little less. (If you forget this step, as I sometimes do, no worries. They’ll still taste great.) Brush the tops with butter, if so desired.

Bake at 350° for 15 minutes, or 325° for 18 minutes. They have a tendency to get very brown on the pan side, especially if your oven runs hot like ours. Make sure to switch racks halfway through and keep the racks far enough from the top and bottom of the oven.

You will love these, and that’s an order. They’re good for any kind of dinner demanding rolls, and even better dunked in hot chocolate for breakfast.

Oh, and as a bonus, if you do them right, they look like [a lich’s horns](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lich_(character)). Use that to get your littlest creep to eat them, if nothing else.
