<div style="text-align: center;">+++</div><div><span>[The apostle Paul tells us that “since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have access to grace, and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God.” Therefore]</span> Let us pray to God for our own needs and for the needs of others.</div><div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span>*Silent Prayer*</span></div><div><span>*  
*</span></div><div><span>We pray this morning for the sick, the suffering and the lonely, especially…, that they may be blessed with your presence and our companionship.</span></div><div><span>Gracious God, **hear our prayer.**</span></div><div><span>**  
**</span></div><div><span>We pray today for those who have been rejected by those they have attempted to join, and for our own community, that we might have the endurance through times of frustration and loss to replant the seeds of welcome in this place.</span></div><div><span>Gracious God, **hear our prayer.**</span></div><div><span>**  
**</span></div><div><span>We pray today for those who face trial and persecution, whether innocent or guilty. We pray especially for Carly Ottery</span>, that she might know life after tragedy, and that she might find acceptance as a flawed but forgiven child of God. Form those who have done wrong, and all of us, in your character of love, forgiveness, and faithfulness.</div><div><span>Gracious God, **hear our prayer.**</span></div><div><span>**  
**</span></div><div><span>We pray today for hope in a world that seems so lacking in it. Reassure us of the future which you have promised us, and in this time of terrible political division, inspire us to welcome one another in friendship, no matter what happens on Tuesday.</span></div><div><span>Gracious God, **hear our prayer.**</span></div><div><span>**  
**</span></div><div><span>We pray today for your love to be poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, that we might make room in our hearts and our lives for new members at Salem, and all those friends we have yet to meet. Open us to be a blessing to ourselves and others.</span></div><div><span>Gracious God, **hear our prayer.**</span></div><div><span>**  
**</span></div><div><span>Father, we ask that you hear all these prayers and the ones we have left unspoken, through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, who has reconciled us to you and calls us to welcome others in his name. In his name, and through the power of his Holy Spirit, we pray. **Amen.**</span></div>
