It might have been Henry David Thoreau, or it might have been E.B. White—I no longer remember, and most of my books are now packed away under a friend’s basement stairs—but someone once wrote that a man who was too busy to look up in the fall and watch a line of geese pass was too busy to live. I’ve always agreed, and at least tried to live by the advice.

One of the pleasures of our recent move is that our day ends quite a bit earlier than it used to. Jen’s almost always done with work at 3:00, when we go to pick up Bill at school. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I’m out a little later: I teach until 4:00, get home a little before 5:00. We’re busy, don’t get me wrong, but we have few evening commitments, and almost no meetings outside of work hours. Best of all, I know that when I’m done with work, I’m done. The phone won’t ring with some emergency (real or imagined) from church. We like that. The strange part will come on Sunday, when I don’t have to roll out of bed and into the shower to get to church on time. But you get used to that.

We decided to put our extra time to good use this evening by going for a family walk. At my insistence, we went to Fond du Lac’s wonderful Lakeside Park complex. As the name suggests, it’s right on Lake Winnebago, with a broad-lawned promenade shaded by trees running along the shoreline.

South of the lake, there are a series of canals and ponds crossed with pedestrian bridges, and punctuated with flowerbeds, benches and massive oaks. We stopped at a gazebo so Bill could run around, then ambled across a covered bridge. On the far side, to our right, ran a loop of miniature train. To the left was a deer pen, surrounded by chain-link fence and topped by barbed wire. An antlered buck, so still I thought he was a statue at first, stood at one side. Farther down there were a doe or two and a yearling. We debated whether there were any coyotes in Fond du Lac to threaten the deer family.

We had hoped to cross another canal and come up on a lighted baseball field, but we found no obvious route forward. So we went back across the street to look at the fancy old bandstand the And walk out the stone jetty to take the lake breeze. Bill laughed to scare away a flock of seagulls on our way out. Almost at the very end of the jetty were a few yew trees for a wind screen, and a jumble of rocks to cap the structure. Mama assured Bill that it would be a good place to bring a boy or girl for kissing when he got to high school. Ewww! He cried.

Perhaps a third or half a mile away, there’s a nice-looking white lighthouse, but it was getting dark, so we decided not to walk it. Instead, we drove down to take a peek from the parking lot, then looped around and went back out the other way, past the Fond du Lac Water Works. The detour cost us: the railroad lights dropped down on the crossing at Scott Street and Van Dyne. We waited patiently for a few minutes, inclined to chalk it up to watching if not geese, then the CSX. But when the damn thing stopped and started backing up, we bailed and headed down to the overpass at Johnson Street. A man too busy to watch the geese go by is too busy to live. A man too busy to watch the train go by probably has a son who needs to take a shower and go to bed.
