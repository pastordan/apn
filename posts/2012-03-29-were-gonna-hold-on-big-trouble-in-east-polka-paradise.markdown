Bad news is breaking out all over the place in this neck of the woods. The school district has to close a $900,000 deficit, caused in roughly equal parts by decreased property taxes revenues, the end of a federal grant, and an ill-timed boost to the technology budget. All of this will be paid for by staff cuts, outsourcing, consolidation, and whatever other forms of belt-tightening can be jerry-rigged to demonstrate Fiscal Conservatism. And all of it will bring out the yahoo element at the initial public hearing, which I expect to be full to the brim with weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth about how dreadfully expensive public education is, and how taxpayers simply cannot afford to give a single penny more to those Cadillac-driving union-minioning teacher monsters!

All the while, the same people crying about the dire financial straits of our school district are preparing to gang up on our local school principal for having the temerity to combine two grades in a single class. Never mind that one of those classes has just nine kids in it. Never mind that when it was tried this year, the parents and teachers said it worked better than they expected. For some reason, people hold a grudge toward this principle, and seem bound and determined to be angry about the situation, irrationally so.

The garnish on all of this is news that the local pharmacy will close. It was announced yesterday that the shop will close today at 3:00, as part of a corporate restructuring by the local health-care giant. That means the next time Bill gets sick, we’ll have to travel at least ten miles to have the doctor’s prescription filled. As with the school district cuts, it also means longtime employees will be out of work.

We knew when we moved to a rural area that things would be dicey at times. A tough economy means tough decisions, and the world seems to be geared toward consolidation these days.

We knew as well that attitudes would not always be, shall we say, constructive. We’ve lived with conservative and/or rural folks for a long time now. We know how profoundly backward looking they can be, how loud and nasty their opinions can be, how closed off they can get when it comes to new ideas or new people. None of that is anything those same folks don’t say about themselves, and none of it means that city or suburban slickers are so much better. They have different—but no less significant—problems of their own.

I wouldn’t be honest, though, if I said we haven’t had moments where we think about packing it all in and moving to somewhere safe. There is something in the water here, something that has definitely gotten worse since Obama came into office and the Tea Party Revolution began, something small-minded and parochial in the worst sense of the word. It tries our patience. It makes us want to run far, far away.

But how far away is far enough? Milwaukee has its own problems, and even Madison, for all its many wonders, is still in a Wisconsin led by Scott Walker and the Fitzgerald brothers. It has its own problems, too. So what do you do? Jen doesn’t like California, and even I concede Los Angeles can’t be lived by our standards. Our parents would probably get over us moving to Canada, but they have whackjobs there too. We’d like England, I think, but that would just open up a whole new set of problems.

The truth is, you can’t run from this crap. Every community has its ups and downs, positive players and the negative. All you can really do is tend your own garden, like Voltaire said. Or as I like to think of it, hold on and hope for the best. The Lord Jesus himself brought us here to see if we can make some kind of a difference. As discouraging as it might be some days, I’m not ready to give up on that call, and I’m sure as hell not interested in getting run out of town by a bunch of boo-birds. I’m too competitive for that, and there’s too much good to be done here. Who wants to start a co-op pharmacy with me?

One more thing before we close with a shamelessly sentimental duet from George Jones and Tammy Wynette: my thanks and heartfelt appreciation to both the teachers and staff at the Kewaskum School District, and the worker bees at the pharmacy. You’re going to take the brunt of a lot of stuff that wasn’t your fault, and you have done a really good job taking care of my family and many families like it. So, thank you and sorry things have to end this way.
