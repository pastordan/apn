[Michael Klarman,](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-klarman-gay-marriage-and-the-courts-20120212,0,2646664.story) writing in the *Los Angeles Times*, gets the story right:

> Why is gay marriage inevitable? First, the basic insight of the gay rights movement over the last four decades has proved powerfully correct: As more gays and lesbians have come out of the closet, the social environment has become more gay friendly. In turn, as the social environment has become more hospitable, more gays and lesbians have felt free to come out of the closet. This social dynamic is powerfully reinforcing and unlikely to be reversed.One factor that most strongly predicts support for gay equality is knowing someone who is gay. As more gays and lesbians come out of the closet, more parents, children, siblings, friends, neighbors and co-workers know or love someone who is gay. Because few people favor discrimination against those they know and love, every gay person coming out of the closet creates more supporters of gay equality.
> 
> The number of Americans reporting that they know somebody who is openly gay tripled between 1985 and 2000, reaching 75%. One study in 2004 found that among those who reported knowing someone who is gay, 65% favored either gay marriage or civil unions, while only 35% of those who reported not knowing any gay people supported them.
> 
> A second reason that gay marriage seems inevitable is that young people so strongly support it. One study by political scientists found a gap of 44 percentage points between the oldest and youngest survey respondents in their attitudes toward gay marriage. A 2011 poll found that 70% of those age 18 to 34 supported gay marriage. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which young people’s support for gay marriage dissipates as they grow older.

This is all quite aside from changing views on the Supreme Court, and the utter lack of compelling interest for states wanting to ban same-sex marriages. There’s really just no reason to bar gays and lesbians from getting married as a legal matter other than wanting to lessen them and their relationships. Eventually, that truth will work its way up the courts and we’ll have marriage equality across the land. I am so certain of this that I’ve told even my conservative parishioners to get ready for a day when same-sex marriage is legal. That’s a statement of simple fact, not advocacy.

Anyway, in more reasonable times (which is to say, not in the middle of a presidential campaign when all one side has in its arsenal are social issues), we wouldn’t have to say such a thing, but today we do: The sea change our society is not the result of any “war on religion.” That’s a bunch of nonsense foisted on our national conversation by people whose grip on the short hairs of American morality is slipping by the minute.

Instead, two things are going on. First, Americans of all ages increasingly [don’t give a shit](http://www.barna.org/culture-articles/50-americans-describe-their-moral-and-social-concerns-including-abortion-and-homosexuality) what their neighbors do in the privacy of their own home. About ⅓ of people surveyed say that homosexuality is a top concern, and many less bring the subject up if it’s not suggested to them It’s only the Evangelicals who drag things to the right, as they do with many social and political questions.

But second, younger people of all stripes just don’t see homosexuality as an issue. At least, they don’t care if their friends are gay or straight or whatnot. When it comes to the church, it’s a different story. *91%* of young non-Christians and *80%* of young churchgoers say the church is homophobic. That’s not creeping secularism; that’s disappointment in the witness of the church, and it makes *two* things inevitable: marriage equality and empty pews, unless Christians begin to make it clear that they don’t hate them some gays. Or lesbians. Or bisexuals. Or transgendered.

Oh, heck, why don’t we quit while we’re ahead and just not hate anybody?
