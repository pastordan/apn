<div><span>According to second or third or fourth-hand gossip, “Everybody in the Town of Wayne hates Pastor Dan,” apparently because three or four years ago I had the nerve to go to a liquor license renewal hearing to point out that the bar in question was not a good neighbor. Since then I have complained exactly once to the town chairman when the bar flouted the restrictions placed on them.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>This is enough to make me a pariah in the smelt-eating circuit, at least if some people are to be believed.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>As you might imagine, I am not overly concerned by any of this. First of all, I know it’s not true, not even close. Second, I don’t need the esteem of any of the people in question. It is a bit odd to think that I might have a reputation as a monster in certain segments of my neighborhood. Among other awfulness, I caused some pews to be turned sideways in the sanctuary so that they form a “U” shape rather than strict ranks. I am a monster, I tell you. But I rarely interact with the people outside the congregation who would listen to such things, and let’s be honest, their opinion doesn’t count for very much. They are chronically and severely unhappy, and most of their complaints go in one ear and out the other.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>The only reason I bring this up at all—other than to have a larf about it—is the culture it reveals. There seems to be a subset of our township that is both reactionary and entrenched. They’re mostly what you might call “country people,” or “low-information voters” in another context. They’re not very well educated, and they tend to have low social mobility. They don’t move around very often, or travel outside their tight circle of family and friends, and they tend not to move very far up the social ladder. The two of those are connected: taking the kind of job that moves you very far up the scale tends to take you away from the area. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but not many. So if you want to live in this rural area close to your family, you might have to take a job in the local factory, or driving a truck, or working construction.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>I’ve seen this in other parts of the country, most notably Central Pennsylvania, where people are downright proud to die thirty feet from where they were born. But I’m told the same culture exists around the nation, in rural Maine and inland California, among other places.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>What is very curious to me is how the culture sponsors a certain frame of mind that borders on mental illness. Any pastor reading this will know what I mean when I talk about the “theology of scarcity” that pervades the church. It is the sense that there is never enough time or money or interpersonal resources to meet the challenges set before us. These folks feel like they start life in a hole that they can never quite climb out of, a hallmark of clinical anxiety. Some of them go farther, turning to a bit of paranoia to explain those forces out to hold them down. Black presidents and pastors who won’t put up with the “good enough” that they’ve learned to suffer with, among other things.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>It might make a good article to think about how this negativity might be correlated to the decline of social mobility in the United States. It’s probably not an accident that the “good old days” that people look back on are the 1950’s, when upward mobility was almost at its peak. These days, it’s as low as it has been since right after World War I. That might make people a bit grumpy.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>I’m curious to know what anyone else’s experiences with this culture might be. Have you seen it? Do you have any idea what causes it? Have you heard yet that everybody hates me? Because they do, they totally do.</span></div>
