[Luke 12:13–21](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=147702593)

Today’s gospel lesson is one of those stories that make sense only in context. Just before Jesus’ lesson and parable, he’s been telling a large audience not to be afraid of dying for God. It’s not the end of the world, he tells them. Worse things could happen.

He’s just finishing up that lesson when he’s interrupted by someone with an off-topic request: tell my brother to give me my inheritance! He refuses, saying, “Who made me judge or arbitrator over you?” That’s interesting in itself, because remember back to [Exodus](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=147702926), where Moses comes across two Israelites fighting, and when he intervenes, one of them responds, “Who made you a ruler and judge over us?” So Jesus, unlike Moses, will not be the judge of individuals against one another. (My father suggests that this is because he is the judge of all creation and therefore concerned with the broader picture.)

In any event, in response to this request, Jesus warns against greed, and uses a parable to illustrate his message. He then [goes on, past where today’s lesson ends](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=147702635), to tell the crowd not to worry about material possessions, but to be generous with their wealth:

> Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.  
> …  
> Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

It’s a bit unfair to separate this morning’s lesson from the rest of this material. Read in context, Jesus’ message is quite clear, and quite hard: just as his followers should be unafraid to give up their lives, so they should be unafraid to give up all that they have. It’s not the end of the world to have nothing to your name, he tells them. Worse things could happen.

As I say, it’s quite difficult to follow Jesus’ advice: “Sell your possessions, and give alms.” It’s not *impossible*: people do it. Part of the inspiration for the monastic movement in the 300’s and 400’s A.D. was the desire to live out Jesus’ commandments literally. So you’d have monks and nuns going off into the desert to live a life of poverty and prayer. More recently, we have the example of people like Mohandas Gandhi, who is said to have owned only 12 items when he died: two pairs of sandals, his watch and eyeglasses, a book, a few bowls, and so on.

But you and I are not Gandhi. We’re not monks either. What can we get from this very difficult lesson?

Just this: the Greek word that Jesus uses for “greed” is *pleonexa*, which literally means “to have more,” and by extension the desire to have more. As the Greek writer [Plutarch says](http://books.google.com/books?id=eum1ijxbr6kC&pg=PA198&lpg=PA198&dq=Plutarch+greed+pleonexia&source=bl&ots=JlsCJHtdCT&sig=u64OG7EOJsIghcYLPzCnNb3wjoU&hl=en&ei=FvlVTN7TKYygnQeklKGUAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Plutarch%20greed%20pleonexia&f=false), “greed”—*pleonexia*—”never rests from acquiring more.”

The trick, then, is to know when you have enough, when enough is enough. That’s part of the reasoning behind the cornucopia spread out on the altar this morning. All of this came from our garden, which, when push comes to shove, isn’t all that big, and I don’t have it planted particularly tight. Yet it produced all of this food for the body and for the soul.

Again, we have to make some allowances here. I bought the seeds for my garden from a commercial company, and I had enough to money to invest in weedkiller, and Jim brought over some manure mixed with dirt. So when I garden, I start out in a much better position than even the rich fool in Jesus’ parable, and if I fail, Jen can always go to the grocery store and feed us that way. But the point is that gardening is a simple pleasure. You don’t have to have fancy, expensive foods. Homegrown carrots and potatoes and onions are enough. And if you’re like me, you don’t need a boat or a luxury car or some other expensive hobby to pour your money into. Gardening is enough.

Now, you might say, and why not, “Pastor, get off your high horse! You’re just as bad as anybody else.” I plead guilty. I have a nice laptop that I am very pleased to own, I have some nice clothes and two decent cars, and we have very nice stuff in our house. We are not in want.

So I don’t want to judge anybody. We all think we know when enough is enough, and we’re all probably kidding ourselves to greater or lesser extent. The point here is first to avoid getting caught in that rat race where enough is never enough, where you are constantly in pursuit of a bigger house or a bigger boat or a fancier car or what have you. Don’t let your possessions own you, in other words.

But second, and this is the other reason we have all this produce on the table today, there comes a point when you have to say “I have enough. Now it’s time to be generous with God.” And God’s favorite act of generosity, as I’m sure you know, is for us to share with one another. So please, take anything you see here: the flowers, the vegetables, the bread. *Please* take a zucchini. Just leave the glads: I promised those to Mrs. Pastor.

If you do take something, take these lessons along with it:

- God will provide.
- Because God will provide, I don’t have to worry. I have enough.
- Because I have enough, I can afford to share with those who do not.

May those lessons enter our individual hearts and into the heart of our community. Amen.
