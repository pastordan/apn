[Mark 10:6-9](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=297611694)

Diane and Travis came to talk to me a few weeks ago about today’s service as part of the normal planning process. They made it abundantly clear in our meeting that they didn’t want the typical 15 minute ceremony: in, out, off to the reception. They wanted—and got—a full worship service.

They thought that communion would be just fine, which surprised me. Nobody ever wants to do communion. But Diane was quite emphatic that she wanted a real sermon. “None of this ‘a few words’ business,” is more or less what she said.

That really surprised me. Nobody wants to hear what the minister has to say at a wedding. Nobody.

But Diane did. We have a lot else going on this afternoon, so this won’t be as long as my usual sermon, but you got it.

I suspect that Travis and Diane wanted to pack so much into their wedding because they wanted it to be a true celebration. They wanted to make it memorable for themselves and for their family and friends.

But they wanted it long because they wanted it to be a true worship service, not a dressed-up Justice of the Peace ceremony. They wanted to invite God into their wedding. That is out of the ordinary these days, and it is commendable. Thank you for that.

We read in the Gospel of Mark that God made humans “male and female,” echoing [the book of Genesis](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=297611802). We modern people hear this as saying that God created the genders to complement one another: that men were made for women, and vice versa. But it actually announces the blessing of God on all people. Women are not inferior to men, and while husbands may work for their wives, neither are they inferior to women.

I believe this will be a marriage of equals. Diane may set the agenda, but that’s because she is so organized.

I insist on the point of equality because God created us in love and for love, and love can never truly be love if it is not shared between equals. [I Corinthians](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=297611871) shows us the way of love between partners building a life together.

Diane, Travis: you must be patient with one another. You must be kind. You must not envy one another’s successes, you must not brag about your own. Don’t get mad at one another for no reason, forgive and forget what has happened before—but at the same time, work on improving how you communicate with one another, how you resolve problems. You are not bad at those things, but all successful marriages practice and get better at their relationship.

Protect, trust, and find hope in one another. Most of all, don’t give up. It is all too common for couples to simply throw in the towel these days. You don’t want that, and none of us want that for you.

The reward for doing your best and following Paul’s advice is not a long and happy married life. That is the result of the struggle you embrace together. When you work hard to be married, the happiness appears like a mysterious guest between you.

But if you are loving, if you are patient and kind and all the rest, the reward is that you will know fully, even as you are known. You will come to know one another better and better, good sides, bad sides, weird sides. Your faults will be forgiven, and your strengths will be celebrated.

You think you know one another pretty well right now, but wait twenty years. You will give—and receive—more forgiveness and understanding that you ever believed possible.

What makes this truly a sermon is this: the promise of God is that even as we know one another, so too will we know and be known by God. We will be forgiven for our sins, and forgive the doubts and grievances we hold toward God.

You, and we, are on a far greater journey than we could have ever imagined. We are on the way to God. May your marriage be a blessing and a comfort to you on the way, and may it point you and all of us in the right direction to meet your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
