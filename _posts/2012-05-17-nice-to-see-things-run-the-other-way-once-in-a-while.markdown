When you hear about a [congregation splitting from its parent denomination to join another communion](http://www.news-journal.com/news/local/longview-first-presbyterian-church-might-split-from-national-group/article_03d7be02-da24-5ed7-b068-ce847c7e83a4.html), it’s almost always a conservative church breaking away from a (supposedly) liberal body. But holy cow, what’s this?

> As throngs of religious conservatives break from the U.S. Presbyterian Church over the ordination of gay ministers, a small gay-led California parish is staging a schism of its own, saying the church has done too little to accept homosexuality.
> 
> The [West Hollywood Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-usa-gays-presbyterianbre8481ex-20120509,0,3250396.story) plans to formally join the ranks of the more liberal United Church of Christ on Saturday.

When was the last time you read a news article about a congregation unhappy that its denomination had done too *little* for the gay cause?

Anyway, it’s a nice story. West Hollywood’s Presbytery was supportive of the move, figuring (probably rightly) that the congregation just wasn’t going to be a fit in the larger body any time in the foreseeable future. Under a new policy designed to make church departures less painful all around, the Presbytery voted to allow West Hollywood to keep its property. They even[ declined to kick the pastor in the ass on the way out](http://www.shuckandjive.org/2012/05/redwoods-presbytery-refuses-to-rebuke.html) (they could have lifted her ministerial standing for officiating at a same-sex marriage ceremony).

The article records lots of appropriate mixed emotions. Well, the PCUSA’s loss is the UCC’s gain. Seems only appropriate to pick up a church once in a while, seeing as how that’s how we lose most of our members these days. But it turns out to be how we *gain* most of our members these days. The UCC has seen several large congregations—often Baptist—join in recent years, and [smaller churches continue to choose to affiliate with us](http://www.ucc.org/news/longing-for-sister-and.html) in a steady drip. In a few years, we’ll have some hella big family fights trying to bring unity out of this theological goulash, but oh well. The more’s the merrier. Nobody ever said the Kingdom was neat and tidy. It’s a ferkakte mess, just like our ecclesiology, and that’s the truest UCC statement you’ll ever hear.
