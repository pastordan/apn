Why am I not surprised by this update to our [Crystal Cathedral story](http://www.christianpost.com/news/schuller-coleman-breaks-away-from-crystal-cathedral-71217/) from the other day?

> It was Senior Pastor Sheila Schuller Coleman’s last Sunday at the Crystal Cathedral’s Garden Grove building in Orange County, Calif., as she announced that she is starting a new church.
> 
> Hope Center of Christ will be the name of the church. Coleman, a daughter of Crystal Cathedral founder Dr. Robert H. Schuller, expects to find a location for her breakaway church this week.

Coleman is literally suborning schism here, inviting the members who side with her family to leave the congregation and form a new church with her. In other words, the Schullers are taking their ball and going home. Oh, and they’re taking the “Hour of Power” producer and the head of the music ministry with them. They seem to have mistaken the church for themselves.

This is hardly “positive thinking.” Non-denominational megachurch or single-cell family church, this what we call a lack of boundaries—not to mention ethics—in the pastoring game.
