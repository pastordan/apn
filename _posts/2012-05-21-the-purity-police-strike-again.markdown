Just the other day, [I was preaching on Peter and Cornelius](http://www.salemwayne.org/2012/05/13/the-word-for-the-week-may-13-2012-welcome/), and I made this comment during the sermon:

> Not many of us, I think, would refuse to shake hands with someone who was gay or lesbian, and I don’t know of any churches that would refuse to allow members to enter the sanctuary if they had been to the house of a gay person. But that’s exactly what might happen to Peter as a result of his visit to Cornelius. He won’t be allowed in the Temple. He might not be allowed in a synagogue. He might not be able to touch another Jew, or have dinner with them, until he is ritually purified. And if he keeps it up, sooner or later, the other Jews are not going to want to have anything to do with him. At all. Ever.

Uh, yeah. How’s that working out for me?

> He doesn’t even play baseball. But pastors of three churches in Saint Clair, Mo., have decided that the [Rev. James Semmelroth Darnell](http://www.ucc.org/news/ucc-churches-in-missouri-step.html) plays for the wrong team.
> 
> When the pastors of the Bethel Baptist Church, Friendship Baptist Church and Liberty Baptist Church learned that Darnell, pastor of the St. John United Church of Christ, is bisexual, they decided their Christian league teams could no longer compete against the UCC church team. Bisexual, the pastors said, is unbiblical.

First [some Catholics won’t play against a co-ed baseball team](http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/05/11/482600/catholic-school-forfeits-arizona-state-baseball-championship-rather-than-face-a-co-ed-team/), and now this. I know it’s the national pastime and all, but seriously, Honus Wagner is not going to cast you into the lake of fire come judgment day because you played against somebody who has two x chromosomes, or somebody who knows somebody who’s bisexual.

I think we need a new vision for Peter: a bag of baseball equipment being lowered from the skies and a voice booming, “Rise, Peter. Stretch and play.”
