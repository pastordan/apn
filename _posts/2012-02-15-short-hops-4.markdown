- You’ve probably noticed that I seem to be back on the slippery slope of punditry. It’s true. I finally have time, energy, and clarity to tackle a subject or two these days. I’ll try to keep it to that—a subject or two—and I promise to keep the personal stories in the mix. As always, the posts are labeled so you can skip the ones you don’t want to read.

- I can’t wait to get my hands on [this book](http://www.prweb.com/releases/christianityafterreligion/dianabutlerbass/prweb9194670.htm), and I am *so* not kidding about that. Diana’s a great writer and a wonderful person to boot. It also looks like she touches on some areas that I’ve devoted a great deal of thought to over the past couple of years, so I’ll be curious to see where she comes out on the issues. I’m intending to review it somewhere, and I promise I won’t make fun of it, much.

- [This](http://twitpic.com/8jlyz3) is awesome, from one of my favorite cartoonists.

- From a book I’m reading: In ‘Productivity and Existence’…[Martin] Buber distinguishes between legitimate creativity and that specious productivity which wears itself out turning all experience into communication.
In the past seven years, I’ve written a book, approximately 10,000 pages worth of blog posts and over 13,000 tweets. I just thought I should tell you that. No reason.
