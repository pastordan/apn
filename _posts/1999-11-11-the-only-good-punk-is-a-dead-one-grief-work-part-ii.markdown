It’s happened again. I had every intention of writing my sermon today, long before deadline. The church has a new secretary, which makes life easier: she affords me the luxury of at least thinking that for once, my sermon will be done early. Dreams of luxury seldom take realities of laziness into account, however. I allowed myself to get side-tracked onto working on a chart of church giving over the past year. Despite my very limited math skills, I’m convinced that if I just stare at the charts for a little while longer, I’ll find something better to say than “we need more people in church each week if we’re going to meet the budget.” So I wasted a good two or three hours that might have been more profitably devoted to writing the sermon. Procrastination is an art form unto itself, however, and if we don’t soon figure out what to do about the budget, I may not have a call to write sermons for anymore. On the other hand, the best advice I’ve gotten on the subject is to let faith lead the growth in both people and money, so maybe I’d better get down to that sermon after all…

 It’ll get written, don’t worry. I want to talk to you first. If I didn’t have to run to a couple of hospitals this afternoon, I’d tap out the sermon, too. But sickness and death tend to run in cycles, I’ve discovered, and colleagues tell me their experience is similar. No one’s died recently, thank God, but one parishioner just had open-heart surgery, another had a hip replacement, and a third is in for who knows what-all. Yet another had balloon angioplasty performed the day before yesterday, but she’s already home, and I’ll catch up with her this weekend. Don’t even ask when I’ll get around to seeing the shut-ins. December is the short answer. Maybe I’ll just have to skip choir practice tonight and scratch out the sermon in longhand at my dining-room table. Or maybe I’ll do it Saturday morning, before the wedding party shows up. Depends on how I feel after I get done with my visits this afternoon.

As I finished last weeks’ column, another thought occurred to me. What exactly has died here? I wondered. Or, more properly, what is it that I’m grieving? As my counselor girlfriend was quick—so quick—to point out, grief doesn’t require death. Any old loss will do.

 This should be a no-brainer to anyone who has known me for more than about six minutes. My primal self-image, up until now, has always been that of one kind of rolling stone or another. I say “one kind or another” because the image takes different forms. When I’m angry or just plain grumpy, I think of myself as an unreconstructed punk rocker. I’ll sigh, and wonder why I never did get my Doc Martens and a leather jacket. Or I’ll look in the mirror and regret that the old pate is getting a little thin for a decent mohawk. For that matter, I couldn’t even work up a good pompadour without some hair weaves. Seems like the days of cool hair are now lost. Thank God for cd’s, though. I’ll be listening to the Clash singing about not getting “fat and old” well into the next century.

 It’s probably a bit more mature to picture myself as a Beat Generation writer. A hair’s breadth. I never could equal William S. Burroughs on terms of pure sinister, but then, who could? I had a fair start on drinking as much as Jack Kerouac, and I’m actually probably only slightly less politically active than Allen Ginsburg was at this point in his life. But I never even hit the halfway mark on the only novel I tried to write, and I’ve never been much of a poet. You might think that I’d be ruled out on the grounds of not having traveled much, and certainly not to any exotic locations. But, truth to tell, the Beats didn’t go all that far, either. Burroughs was probably the best-traveled of the bunch: he made a long circle from New York City through Texas, Mexico City, Panama, Morocco, Paris and London before settling in Manhattan, then Kansas in his last years. Ginsburg was an adept tourist, but lived really between New York and Berkeley or Boulder for most of his life.

 As for Jack, he of On the Road fame, one of the famous facts of his life is that he actually didn’t travel that much. Sure, there were a few long-distance roadtrips with Neal Cassady, and he spent some time in San Fran and Mexico City. But most of the time, he lived safely on Long Island or in Lowell, Massachusetts with his mother. Traveling was more of a safety-valve than a way of life for him. I tell people that if you read Kerouac’s books closely, you discover that it’s exactly that discrepancy between his self-image and the reality of his life that makes the stories go, but I suspect that doesn’t cut any ice with anyone. My family and friends are convinced that I am devoted to St. Jack because I want to be a wild and free bop-jazz hipster, living on jug wine, filterless cigarettes and spontaneous poetry. They never suspect that truthfully, I love Kerouac because I sympathize with the fat, scared little puppy he was. I too know what it’s like to be trapped behind a manual typewriter when spring breezes and convertibles are calling.

 But then, self-image and reality often have precious little to do with one another. In fact, they are often at loggerheads. I had a friend who worked at a tutoring center with me. At the time, she was 23, and well on her way toward earning her Ph.D. in English. She told me something that has stuck with me ever since: everyone in academia, she claimed, wanted to be “mad, bad, or other.” Well, wouldn’t you? If your life consisted of more time spent behind a desk in a library than any healthy person ought to have racked up, wouldn’t you want to claim something a little romantic for yourself? A little bit of insanity, a little bit of menace or strangeness—that’ll keep the depression of the straight arrow away. I probably hung on to my footloose and fancy-free self-image far longer than I needed to simply because I didn’t want to admit that I’d grown up. I get up, I go to work. At night, I watch a little tv, read the paper, then go to bed. It doesn’t get much more “adult” or “boring” than that.

 At this point, I could go off on a screed about how the commercialization of self-image has led us up to the point of having disposable identities. I could tell you as well that the grief in losing self-image is only due to the discovery that this one is no longer viable and will have to be replaced, like outgrowing a beloved sweater or putting a stain on a favorite pair of pants. That’s all true, up to a point. The commercialization of culture has allowed an enormous freedom in the development—and redevelopment—of how we see ourselves. If you don’t believe me, go dig up some pictures of yourself in the 70’s, and tell me if you think you’re the same person now you were then.

 Somehow, though, the material explanation seems unsatisfying. We don’t just buy identity, either directly or through the accumulation of choices made over time. There is a core to most folks that doesn’t change over time. A psychologist would tell you that it’s the personality, which in turn consistently influences the identity. I’d prefer to think that it was the image of God within us: we all burn with God in our own way. The flame can be distorted or weakened, but never finally lost, I think. What was created good remains good, despite our best efforts to have it another way.

 Still, things change, people change. We might be consistent over a period of time, but being consistent doesn’t necessarily mean that we present exactly the same face to the world at all points in our journey. There are many sides to all of us, and certain elements of our identity come out in response to different situations. I still love punk rock, don’t get me wrong, but my job and life nowadays require a bit more peace and quiet. So I turn the racket down, and get on with things. Doesn’t mean I wouldn’t have gone to see GWAR in Philly if I’d had half a chance—but realistically, on a Friday night after a long week, I’d rather buy some comic books and some ice cream and hole up in my room. When the girlfriend arrives from Denver, she probably will not settle for being ignored on a Friday night. I imagine I will end my days watching chick flicks as a stress-buster. It’ll work for her, at least. (As for me, I’ll just sneak the comic books when I think no one’s looking.)

 What I’m trying to get around to saying is that although there is grief in losing an old self-image, I’m a practical enough man not to lose my head over it. Self-image is in many ways about where you would like to go with your life, not where your life is in fact at the present moment. It’s sad to notice the disparity between where you thought you were going, and where you are actually going. It was also sad to say goodbye to Rob and Aimee after visiting with their new baby, but I think I’ll live. Grief, in the end, isn’t really about feeling sad that you’ve lost something or someone. That’s mourning. Grief, on the other hand, is about letting go of what you knew before and reconciling yourself to your current situation, which is why it can happen even when the changes in your life are quite positive. So I’m not really troubled, not really blue, to discover that the old punk in me is dead, and a pastor is living inside his leather jacket. I’m a little sad to see him go, but I’m curious to see what the pastor will bring with him. Maybe a few good soul records? That’s acceptance, and it’s occasioned only by a bit of maturity and the grace of the Good Lord.
