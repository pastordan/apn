[D]mergent is fast becoming one of my favorite blogs, and [this post by Derek Penwell](http://dmergent.org/2012/02/06/just-a-spoonful-why-congregations-cant-just-get-by/) shows why. It’s well-written, insightful, and funny. I’ve known *plenty* of churches who would be happy to turn out the lights, turn down the heat, and do away with “unnecessary expenses” like the pastor’s pay rather than cough up more dough. And the people who have given the same measly $5.00 each week for their entire adult lives will look at you and say, “Why can’t you make some sacrifices for us?”

<div style="text-align: left;">On the other hand, I once worked for a funeral home that got burned one too many times. At the end of the meeting to arrange for services, they would simply ask, “And how would you like to pay for this?” They took credit cards, in case you were wondering.</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/s0aIjyX7vwI" width="420"></iframe></div>
