[Exodus 20:1-21](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=149781870)

Last week, I said that we would talk about the Israelite sense of justice in today’s sermon on the Ten Commandments, and so we shall.

But there’s more to them than that. Walter Brueggemann points out that even before the Israelites hear the commandments, they are eager to obey God’s word, for the simple reason that the Lord is a better master than Pharaoh. The not-so-simple reason here is that God *provides* for them in a material sense far better than Pharaoh ever did. The Lord gives them food and water and the things they need to live in the desert. No Egyptian king could ever manage that.

So, Brueggemann argues, God has led the Israelites from *scarcity* to *abundance*, from want to the “enough” we talked about a few weeks back. And now, in the giving of the law, he calls them to take the next step: from scarcity to abundance to neighborhood, as Brueggemann calls it. In other words, having eased the want that set the Israelites against one another, God wants them to act as neighbors to one another. To put it one more way, we’ve moved from negative to neutral and now we’re ready to move into a positive position. So the Ten Commandments are “the most elemental statement of how to organize social power and social goods for the common benefit of the community.” They’re “the rules” when everyone has enough and more than enough.

Understanding it this way helps to make sense of the various sections of the Decalogue. Commandments 1-3 (I’m taking all of this from Brueggemann) teach the Israelites that is the Lord who can keep them safe and happy, not Pharaoh: “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.” If the Israelites believe that, then they need to act like it: “You shall not make for yourself an idol,” and so on. If you trust me, trust me, not somebody else, is the message.

A special word needs to be said here for the third commandment: “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God,” or “take the Lord’s name in vain,” in the more familiar phrasing. This isn’t “swearing” in the sense of cussing, but perjury, swearing a false oath. If you say “So help me God,” you’d better mean it. Otherwise, it’s like you’re saying God didn’t really lead the Israelites out of slavery, and he can’t *really* help you. That’s a bad thing.

The fourth commandment teaches that “Sabbath rest is an alternative to aggressive anxiety.” It’s not about worshipping God. In fact, the absence of any instruction to worship is rather striking here. The commandment says, “you should take the day off work because God takes the day off.” That’s it.

Now, I know somebody’s going to come up to me after church and say, “I still think they shouldn’t have soccer games or baseball or whatever on Sunday morning. Those kids should be in church!” Perhaps so. But the fact is that this commandment comes about in the context of God’s *enough*. You can afford to take the day off, the Lord teaches Israel, because I will provide for you. So don’t let anyone force you to work without rest, and while we’re at it, don’t you force anyone else to work without rest, either. Don’t worry, I said I will provide, and so I shall.

Commandments five through nine are all about various kinds of neighbors and how to treat them justly. “Honor your mother and your father,” meaning, “take care of them when they are old and no longer able to provide for themselves,” so that your children will do the same for you when the time comes. (This is what passed for a social safety net in those days.)

As for the rest of these, I think it helps to hear them as a friend of mine suggested, translating the Hebrew as “at least don’t” instead of “Thou shalt not”: at least don’t murder. At least don’t sleep around. At least don’t steal, or commit perjury. That’s the least you could do. Really.

That leaves one commandment, the one prohibiting coveting. As Brueggemann explains, this “is not about petty acts of envy. It is about predatory practices and aggressive policies that make the little ones vulnerable to the ambitions of the big ones.” When David the powerful king covets Uriah’s wife Bathsheba, he violates this commandment. He says essentially, “I’m the king. I can do whatever I want, and no subject like Uriah can stop me.” More generally, though, this is an economic commandment. The Israelites are called to treat one another as neighbors—as equals—not exploit one another, as Pharaoh had exploited them. All those statements in the Old Testament about treating immigrants properly stem from the same line of thinking. You know what it was like to be immigrants. You know what it was like to be exploited. So don’t do it to other people.

Well, there you have it. The Ten Commandments explained in 800-some words, or a little more than twice the length of the commandments themselves.

Where does this leave us?

I think where we’re at as a community is in the place of abundance, dipping our toes into the waters of being neighbors. There are a few of us who are still caught up in what they call the “theology of scarcity,” the idea that there’s never enough money or love or grace to go around. And there are a few who have really dived into being neighborly, who’d give you the shirt off their back if you needed it. (You all treat me and my family like neighbors, justly, so no complaints there.) But by and large, we’re at a place of knowing how well God has blessed us, but not quite sure what to do with that blessing.

Well, here’s one answer. I’ve been following Brueggemann, so it seems appropriate to finish out with his thought. He points to Jeremiah 9:24 to discuss what is pleasing to the Lord:

> let those who boast boast in this, that they understand and know me, that I am the Lord; I act with steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the Lord.

God is pleased when we get along with one another and do well by one another. So if we want to take God’s blessing, take that *enough* and more that God has blessed us with, and do something with it, then we’ll follow the suggestions here. We will act with *steadfast love* towards one another: we will stay in covenant with one another, put up with one another’s brokenness and embrace one another’s pain. We will be *just* toward one another, meaning we will act fairly, of course. But more than that: we will act with an eye to “the weak,” the lowly, the humble and the despised, to make sure that they have what they need, and to make sure that they are drawn ever nearer to the center of our circle. And we will *do righteousness*, which means to take action to change the system that creates winners and losers in the first place. Don’t get me started on the subject, because as it happens, I wrote an entire book on it. We could be here all day. But just to give you one example, doing righteousness means going beyond giving to food pantries—as valuable as that work is—to ask why it is that people are going hungry?

I suspect that might be the most difficult step for us to take. Churches like ours don’t have strong traditions of activism, in part because we define community more locally than globally, so we’re not used to thinking in terms of “the system.” That’s okay. I am sure we will take the appropriate step when we are ready.

Right now, I think we’re at the other end, learning about steadfast love. As it happens, next week we will hear of an example of how *not* to do steadfast love when we come to the Golden Calf. In the meantime, let us thank God that he loves us forever and ever in unbroken covenant, and pray that we might love one another in the same way. Amen.
