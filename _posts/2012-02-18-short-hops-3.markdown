- It should be noted that [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17072211) is how things are done in the US.
- Actually, Newt, when he comes to legal matters, [Obama *is* superior to the Pope](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/gingrich-administration-believes-obama-superior-pope).
- The reasoning behind the Obama administration’s idea about [reducing the US nuclear force](http://motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/nuclear-weapons-reduction-obama) is clear, precise—and correct. We wouldn’t have so many nukes in the first place were it not for the pissing match we got into with the Soviets. Absent an escalating threat, it’s cheaper and safer to keep only a few around. (I still think they’re unjustifiable under Just War criteria, though.)
- [Timsanity!!!](http://www.chnonline.org/component/content/article/11022-.html) Umm, yeah. Eww.
- I have no idea if it’s true, but if [Media Matters did get $50,000 to monitor conservative religious news outlets](http://www.christianpost.com/news/media-matters-received-50000-grant-money-to-monitor-religious-media-69706/), good on them. The only problem I’d have with it is that they didn’t use some of the money to pay me to write for them.
- Here’s how [religion and politics](http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/churches-get-the-word-out-on-new-voter-id-rules-b147p2b-139487808.html) interact in a healthy, productive way. The key here is that the churches are helping *everyone* get their vote in, regardless of party. The more citizens participate in the political conversation, the better, from a moral *and* political perspective. Saddest part of the story, though? This: Edman also suggested that voters get out their photo IDs before entering the voting room. “In August, a lot of people got up to the table and started looking around for their ID, and that slows things down,” she said.
That’s why they do it. The point of Voter ID laws—and all of the witch hunts against “voter fraud” that Republicans are conducting these days—is to make voting more difficult. The more difficult it is to vote, the fewer people do it, and the better the GOP does, because the restrictions never do seem to hit white middle-class areas as hard as they do poor and minority areas. Like I said, getting out the vote is doing religion and politics the right way. And [this](http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/leaked-documents-detail-operation-angry-badger-u447pp9-139483133.html) (astroturfing) is not.
