Pretty straightforward, I think. Based mostly on [Psalm 22:25-31, with nods to 1 John 4:7-21 and John 15:1-8](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=202903678). Somehow or another, it worked out neatly (more or less) to write the [Five Practices of Fruitful Congregations](http://fivepractices.org/) into the petitions. Our congregation is currently going through that renewal process, so it’s nice to work them in when I can.

Let our prayer and our praise go out to God from the congregation.

<div style="text-align: center;">*Silent Prayer*</div>Let the poor and the lowly eat and be satisfied, O God. Bring justice to our economy, and move us to compassion for those who are hungry. Make us generous people, Lord, and teach us the truth of scripture: God is love. **Let us live in you.**

Let us always be of good cheer, with our hearts forever lifted up to you, the source of all life and love. Bring joy, energy, and obedience to our inner selves. Make us servant people who respond to your love and set us on fire with the truth of scripture: God is love. **Let us live in you.**

Let all people on earth, whether near or far, remember the God of love and turn to his ways. Bring us the kingdom of love, of humility, of your tender care and concern for the least among us. Make us hospitable people, eager to welcome all people to the faith, devoted to sharing your good news in our words and deeds, and gather your people in the truth of scripture: God is love. **Let us live in you.**

Let all people, whether living or dead, bow down before you. Bring peace and remembrance to the dead, comfort and hope to those who survive them. Make us people who ever learn and grow in their faith, who come to trust you more and more no matter our age, and bless us in the truth of scripture: God is love. **Let us live in you.**

Let the generations to come hear of the deliverance that you have promised to them, those generations that have yet to come into the world. Bring your steadfast love to them and to us, and give us good reason to give you thanks and praise as you watch over…Make us worshipful people, our children and their children after them, and cause us to rejoice in the truth of scripture: God is love. **Let us live in you.**

Those who love God must love their brothers and sisters also, and so we lift up the prayers on our lips and in our hearts, for ourselves and for our fellow Christians. Rejoicing in the good news brought to us by angels and the Spirit, we pray as Christ our savior has taught us, saying…

> *Our Father, who art in Heaven,  
>    hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come,  
> Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.  
> Give us this day our daily bread,  
>    and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  
> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,  
>    for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,  
>    forever and ever. Amen.*
