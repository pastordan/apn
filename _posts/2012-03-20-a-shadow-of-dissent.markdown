While doing some research for some liturgical writing (don’t ask, it’s complicated), I came across this excerpt from a speech given in 1960 by James E. Wagner, co-president of UCC, kvetching about some resistance to the plan to create the United Church of Christ from the remains of two other denominations:

> Moreover, it should not be forgotten that after all these years we have arrived at the point where we are under circumstances of more than ordinary difficulty. Ours has not been the task merely of finding a way to unity for two peoples of historically diverse traditions. That would have required only an exercise of Christian grace and a reasonable modicum of intelligence on the part of the negotiators and the peoples they represented.
> 
> Rather, and infinitely more exacting, we have had always to labor under a shadow which was not a healing shadow, a shadow of dissent, of doctrinaire opposition, of litigation and the threat of litigation, so that the framers of the Basis of Union and as well the Commission to prepare a Constitution have never been free to ask the simple, pure, basic question: What provision, what formulation will enable the United Church of Christ to best express and serve the mind and purpose of her Lord in this generation? Instead, recalling a scripture about being “wise as serpents and harmless as doves,” they have had to exercise a serpentine wisdom and at each step ask the additional, distracting, debilitating question: How can we formulate the provision we are agreed upon in such a way as to offer the least risk of vulnerability to those who are ready to resort to the civil courts since they have not been able to sustain their cause within the fellowship of the churches?
> 
> The necessity of continual recourse to this question has had the one major effect upon the peoples of both constituencies, and on their representatives in union negotiations and planning, of heightening sensitivities to differences which would never have arisen to harass them if they had not had to labor under the constant haunting of the ill-dispositioned specter of the litigious spirit.*

It’s tempting to take the cheap shot: the UCC has been dealing with intransigent wingnuts since before the Goldwater Revolution! It’s simply not true, though: many of the dissenters that Wagner points to were in fact good liberals concerned with making sure that everyone got a chance to vote on the merger.**

It does seem like an eerie premonition of a whole lot of crap we’ve been through in our society, both in and outside of the church. Some days it seems like *nobody* wants to work with *nobody* these days. Again, I’d love to point fingers at conservatives, but as my Paul Ryan-loving church treasurer pointed out to me the other day, for fans of Scott Walker, the union uprising sure seems like a shadow of dissent and doctrinaire opposition. It all depends on your perspective, I suppose.

It’s also a useful reminder for those of us in the church world that stubbornness, division, criticism, backbiting, the whole lot of it, is written into the DNA of the church. It may show up more in the UCC because of our peculiar structures, but it’s in every church. And while it may be a painful side to life together, it is not necessarily an unhealthy one. Bonhoeffer says that the church is God’s instrument for containing the imperfections of the world. In this case, it’s the many opinions and conflicting commitments any group must have. In order for the church to be the church, its members must be open to one another’s perspectives in more than a superficial way. That means putting up with one another, and hanging in there through the conflict, as irritating and crazy-making as it might be. It’s what we owe to one another as brothers and sisters in Christ, whether in a local congregation, an association or conference, or in the wider society.

**The bone of contention—at least one of them—was that the Evangelical and Reformed church voted in *synods*, rather than as individual churches, as the Congregationalists did.
