Went to a funeral this morning for [a wonderful friend of the family](http://www.cressfuneralservice.com/obituary/91567/Charles-Schoenwetter/), held at [Memorial United Church of Christ in Fitchburg](http://www.memorialucc.org/), my home congregation, more or less.* It was a good send-off, with stories, songs, scripture and prayer scattered over an hour.

I was impressed by two things in the service: first, the hymns weren’t the typical “How Great Thou Art,” “In the Garden” and “Amazing Grace.” Instead, we sang “What Wondrous Love Is This,” “Precious Lord, Take My Hand” and “For All The Saints,” which is one of my favorites. The choir chimed in with the secular song “When You Come to the End of the Day” and the hymn “Won’t You Let Me Be Your Servant,” one of the decedent’s favorites.

But the way they *started* the service was great, and I highly recommend it for anyone who can pull it off. A soloist sang the verses to “Shall We Gather At The River” and the congregation responded with the chorus while the pastor led the family in and seated them at the front of the sanctuary. By the time the hymn was done, he was ready to lead us all in the prayer, and we made a seamless transition into worship. Well done! (It did help that Memorial has a small sanctuary that was filled in this case with strong voices, which makes the singing that much better for everybody. It’s a useful reminder that to build good singing in the congregation, it’s best to move them together so they can hear themselves.)

*I grew up with Memorial when they were in a different building. They moved out to Fitchburg when I was in college.
