I attended an ecumenical conference on rural ministry this past weekend, held annually in the city of Dubuque. That I would take up such an opportunity for professional development ought to tell you something about just how exciting my life has become these days.

The opening speaker was a professor of rural sociology with a thick Missouri accent who was met by an impatient room of pastors fiddling with empty coffee cups and wondering when dessert would arrive. The professor cheerfully attempted to help us understand the people in our pews with the help of corny jokes and stories and cultural insights so old they might have had grandchildren. I don’t want to harp on the man, because he was sincere and intelligent and genuinely committed to the well-being of the church. But if anyone has not heard by now the idea that different generations see the world differently, they should check into the validity of their college diploma. My guess is it will turn out to have been printed on high-quality cardboard that could have been put to better use as a cereal box.

After almost an hour of talking about such tidbits as the formative effect the Challenger disaster had on my generation, the professor got around to what I thought was the obvious point, which was how economics shape cultural perspective. Though traumas stick out in our minds, the stagnation of real income for most of the past forty years has done more to shape people my age than the loss of ten space shuttles could ever achieve. When asked why Gen X’ers are so cynical, I used to reply that our first memories of watching television often ran to seeing Pres. Nixon resign or helicopters being pushed off the side of aircraft carriers as Saigon fell. Now I believe that it has more to do with seeing our economic opportunities chipped away, year by year. We’ve never thought there was much future in being us.

You might think that recent events in Wisconsin would confirm this bias. Indeed, some people have claimed that no matter what the legislative outcome, [conservatives have scored a big win in this battle](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/03/03/952402/-The-GOP-Victory-in-Wisconsin). I suppose, if you can claim running down teachers as winning something worth having.

About that legislative outcome, though: it will no doubt face legal challenges, and the State Senators who voted for it will come up against well-organized and well-funded recall campaigns later this year. But for now it is done. We will have to wait to see its final disposition.

There is a lot left undecided in Wisconsin these days. If I can impress upon my out-of-state friends any single point, it is the terrible uncertainty Cheddarheads live with these days. Our school district, like many others, has no idea what its budget might look like next year because state aid has not passed the legislature. The projected shortfall runs into the millions. It’s possible that teachers may be laid off. It’s also possible that our son’s school may be shut. We have no way of telling. I say nothing about cuts to social services that may or may not affect our daughter’s treatment.

Again and again I am asked, how does this end? I don’t know.

Come what may, I discern a light, for myself and my children. It may seem today that the battle is lost. Republicans had the votes to shove through legislation canceling collective bargaining. In short order, they will have enough bodies in the Senate and Assembly to authorize the meanest of budgets. But the cost to them has been delay and thousands—possibly hundreds of thousands—of ordinary people pouring into the streets in opposition. Gov. Walker has poked a hornet’s nest of immense proportions, and seems determined to keep poking it to suit his ideological bent.

Tyrants fear tomorrow, because where there is a future, there is hope that things could be different. It is no accident that Gov. Walker continually pleads that crisis forces his hand. Nor is it accidental that the most controversial measures are the ones that move the quickest. If it doesn’t have to be done right now, it opens the possibility that it doesn’t have to be done at all. Or perhaps things don’t have to be the way they are arranged presently. Tomorrow is the greatest threat there is to an unjust today.

The protestors in the streets of Madison and anyone who watches them with any astuteness have learned this lesson well. The protestors have learned that their voices can be heard, that they can change outcomes, that when they stand together, they can have a future that is meaningfully different than the present. There is no political structure, however imbalanced, however stacked against ordinary people, that withstand this mix of hope and social solidarity. On February 17<sup>th</sup>, it seemed certain that the story had run its course and any opposition to the original bill would come to nothing. Since then, the people have forced one tomorrow after another, evading every opportunity to end the situation *today*. Even now, after the legislation has passed, the end is nowhere near manifest. Tomorrow, tractors and 200,000 protestors are expected on the Capitol Square. By March 2012, it is possible that we may have replaced every Senator eligible for recall and be preparing to vote on Gov. Walker’s future. I don’t envy him the next year.

I am perhaps fanciful enough to see in this chaos the hand of the trickster God Yahweh. He has a track record of being a singularly ill-behaved deity, refusing to bow to conventional expectations of the divine, such as endorsing the rule of whoever happens to be on top of the social heap at the moment. God is no respecter of wealth and privilege, but he does seem inordinately fond of creating new possibilities and disrupting “the seemingly self-evident way things must be.” When the Israelites cried out under the oppression of Pharaoh, the Lord heard them, and began to move them toward freedom, new and unheard of possibilities. No one ever thought that the most powerful ruler in the world could lose his slave labor force! This was simply not the way things were done.

But it did happen, or so the Bible tells us. It took a very long time: Moses was 80 when he appeared before the king of Egypt, and after dickering with him, it took another forty years before Israel had enough of its stuff together to enter into the promised land.<sup>1</sup> In all that time, God remained patient, tugging his children into a new future gently but insistently and creating a way forward where there was none. I will teach my son that in the streets of Madison, God did it again, and that with a little faith and a little grace, the people who have been weighted down for so long with legal and economic injustice can once again be free. I hope and I trust that years in the future, when some sociologist shorthands the character of his generation, he will note their sunny optimism formed by the knowledge that pharaohs come and pharaohs go, the economic tides for working families rise and the tides fall, but through it all, there is always a tomorrow.

<sup>1</sup>They promptly slaughtered the previous residents. I hope this is one piece of the story that will not repeat itself.
