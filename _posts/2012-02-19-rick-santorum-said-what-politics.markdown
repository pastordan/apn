Rick Santorum said [WHAT?!](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/18/10444177-santorum-obama-believes-in-phony-theology-not-based-on-bible)

> Rick Santorum took his rhetoric to a new level, trying to attack President Barack Obama over the controversy between religious freedom and contraception.  
> “It’s not about you. It’s not about you,” Santorum said at a Tea Party rally, directing his comments at the president. “It’s not about your quality of life. It’s not about your job. It’s about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology, but no less a theology.”

> “[O]bviously, he is now forcing people to do things that he believes that they have the right, that they should do,” Santorum continued to say about Obama. “The Catholic church has a Theology that says this is wrong, and he’s saying no I’ve got a different, I’ve got a different — you may want to call it a theology, you may want to call it secular values, whatever you want to call it, it’s a different moral values. And the president of the United States is exercising his values and trumping the values of the church. If you don’t want to call it a theology, I’m fine, you can have them let me know what they want to call it, but it is a different set of moral values that they are imposing on people who have a constitutional right to have their own values within the church, and that’s not a new low. That’s a reflection of exactly what … it is a new low.”

I’ve got some theology *right here* for Mr. Rick Santorum. I’m not sure what else there is to say. Yes, Obama is working from a theology—everyone has a “moral point of view” or “moral values.” Obviously, not everyone is going to have the same set, which is kinda what I think makes America beautiful. But apparently Rick Santorum is running for Pope of the United States and thinks that the First Amendment prohibiting the establishment of a national church doesn’t apply to the Catholic bishops, so shut up. Or something like that.

Anyway, it all has to do with the [vanishingly small number of old white Christians who make up the Republican electorate](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/the-electoral-wasteland/). More than likely, Santorum’s attempt to please this pinhead elite will prevent him from winning the general election. At least, it will if God is just and still loves America. Otherwise, we’re screwed. Sleep tight.
