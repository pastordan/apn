- See if you can [follow the bouncing ball](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/28/michigan-primary-results-2012_n_1305523.html#295_santorum-fails-to-win-michigan-catholics): the Catholics vote for the Mormon, the Evangelicals vote for the Catholic, and the Democrats vote for the Republican. Oh, and the candidates are all horrible people. We hear the circus is hiring.
- “We hadn’t expected to be evicted from the cathedral steps because previously the [church has said it would give us sanctuary](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/feb/28/occupy-london-accuse-st-pauls-betrayal) when there’s a violent eviction,” she said.
- [The Department of Homeland Security](http://animalnewyork.com/2012/02/the-department-of-homeland-security-is-searching-your-facebook-and-twitter-for-these-words/) is watching when you use particular words on Twitter or other social media. So you should never, ever use them on social media. Dangit!
- Our favorite expression is “my bowels move in sympathy with you,” from the prophets. But “[every man that pisseth on the wall](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/25/my-take-stop-sugarcoating-the-bible/?hpt=hp_bn8)” is pretty good too.
- What’s more surprising about [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/28/how-many-neurons-human-brain): that humans have about half a baboon’s brain fewer neurons than previously estimated, or that we may owe the neurons we do possess to the advent of cooking? Correct: that cookies have nothing to do with brain development.
- A [Gaithersburg, Maryland priest denied communion to the lesbian daughter](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-archdiocese-denying-communion-to-lesbian-at-funeral-was-against-policy/2012/02/28/gIQAlIxVgR_story.html) of the decedent at a recent funeral. Obviously, this is an injustice and against the gospel. But as the family members point out, it is first of all a pastoral failure. What kind of a pastor doesn’t show at the graveside and doesn’t make arrangements for someone to cover for him? The diocese says it is “against policy” to deny someone communion under such circumstances. The problem for them—and for the Catholic church as a whole—is that the more they insert themselves into matters of “policy” in these cases, the more they own the inevitable lapses into cruelty. It’s little wonder the family is hearing about friends’ faith being shaken. They’re probably starting to get the idea that this wasn’t an exception but the system working as designed.
