…how’s yours? Here’s a little teaser for you to think about: we recently applied for a spot for our son at a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) charter school in Fond du Lac.

By law, when a charter school in Wisconsin exceeds its enrollment cap, it has to hold an admissions lottery. It can’t weight the lottery in *any* way, except for one. When a family has multiple children applying to the school, those siblings can be grouped with the first kid pulled from the hat. Otherwise, it’s a straightforward random-number generation.

So in our case, there were 100 slots available and 110 total kids who applied. Bill was number 108. There were eight families with multiple children, most of them two per, but one had three or four. As luck would have it, these families placed relatively high on the list: the first was at #6 or 8, and all of them were in the top 50. Without those kids, Bill would certainly be admitted to the school.

So: fair or not fair? Why?
