I took my son to see [the new Tintin movie](http://www.us.movie.tintin.com/) tonight. Ever since, I have been struggling to find words to describe how awful it is. I have failed. To equal the task may require me to summon the zombie Dorothy Parker in order to find the suitable put-down. The last time I came away this disappointed in a film was when some friends took me to see *Natural Born Killers* the night it opened in Washington D.C. When we came out, they asked how I liked it.

“I feel like Oliver Stone just spent two-and-a-half hours pissing on my leg,” I replied.

*Tintin* is like that, but with the added benefit of physical, rather than merely psychological, nausea. On the other hand, that might have just been the 3-D. I’d have to go back and watch it again to be sure. That seems unlikely, to put it mildly. I couldn’t take the trauma. Even if I could, it would be impossible to say for certain if it was just film technology or something else. With a movie this bad, it’s entirely possible that its cartoon characters have developed some sort of personality disorder and just get off on torturing innocent moviegoers. Twenty minutes into it, I was checking my watch. My four-year-old nephew got too scared and had to go home. Lucky bastard.

The guiding logic behind this movie, to the extent I can discern it, was “We can’t fit all the books into one movie. So we’ll take one book, ignore half of it, drop in elements from other books, slap in the ending from yet another one, and then our insurance company will bail our sorry asses out.” Tintin isn’t faithful enough to satisfy fanboys like me, and it so studiously ignores the elements that make the comic books what they are—[Hergé’s famed clean lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligne_claire), the hyper-realism and sly, surprising narratives—that it won’t make any new friends. It is so entirely awful that one suspects that the estate’s heirs only greenlighted the project out of some perverse desire to kill the golden goose, then defile its corpse. In 3-D.

This movie is literal when it should be figurative, it chops when it should expand and vice-versa, it cuts or replaces characters unnecessarily and drags in others where they don’t belong, introduces storylines apparently for no better reason than to take advantage of Dolby surround and 3-D. Even there, it fails. Beyond the aforementioned nausea, there are serious and repeated incursions into the “uncanny valley.” Strangely enough, Snowy and Tintin himself—the most cartoony of all Hergé’s characters—are the most realistically rendered. Other characters, like Captain Haddock or Bianca Castafiore, have their caricaturish features exaggerated out of all reason, leaving their skin to be weirdly, realistically rendered. Nearly three hours after I left, my head still hurts. My stomach is starting to settle down, thanks for asking.

*Tintin* is so obnoxiously, persistently, and intrinsically awful that I am tempted to crack wise about [Steven Spielberg’s non-unionized, Mexican equivalent](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Se%C3%B1or_Spielbergo). But it’s even worse than that. It is so bad, so very, very bad, that it seems more likely that Spielberg’s staff and its non-union, Mexican counterpart started drinking together and produced this misbegotten piece of crap in some kind of three-sheets-to-the-wind, double-dog-dare staredown gone terribly, terribly wrong. Sort of how I imagine [*Metal Machine Music*](http://www.amazon.com/Metal-Machine-Music-Lou-Reed/dp/B00004VXF2) got made, only without Lou Reed.

This movie is so bad that it causes me to question not just whether Steven Spielberg believes in God, but whether he stamped his name on the film simply to cause his fans to rethink their faith. It is the moving pictures equivalent of being left to rot with [the rats in the vacants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(season_4)). I am afraid that even should Dorothy Parker rise from her grave, martini glass in hand, she could not come up with an insult witty or astringent enough to make this flick worth remembering. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go cauterize my brain with a beer and a super-heated tire iron.
