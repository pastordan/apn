I’ve imported the posts from my old [Changing the Script](http://www.changingthescript.com/) site since I’m not using it. Probably I’ll shut it down at the end of the year. In any event, if you really want, <strike>you can scroll back</strike>[click here](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/search/label/CTS) to see some of the posts I did over there.

This shouldn’t effect the morning email, but if it does, I do apologize. It certainly will not affect the regularly scheduled clogging of the intertubes with cat pictures.
