It’s been easily twenty years since I last spoke to [Paul Boyer](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/memorial-service-set-for-uw-history-professor-noted-expert-boyer/article_ccc425ca-784b-11e1-8fbf-0019bb2963f4.html). Oddly enough, I just thought of him the other day when I saw a picture of the old Observatory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. He had a beautiful office there, where I went to see him once or twice. When I heard this morning that he had died of cancer at 76, I was saddened, despite how long it’s been.

I went to high school with Boyer’s son Alex and daughter Katie—they were basically friends of friends—but I took a couple of his intellectual history classes as an undergrad. I learned a lot of post-war history, and way more about pre-millenial and post-millenial dispensationalists than I ever wanted to know. We also read his book [*By the Bomb’s Early Light*](http://books.google.com/books/about/By_the_bomb_s_early_light.html?id=W1feLVv6WTAC), which is as fine a piece of cultural history as you’re likely to come across. I haven’t read it, but friends say his [*Oxford Companion to American History*](http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Companion-United-History-Companions/dp/0195082095) is a great reference work.

Prof. Boyer was also a terrific person, very warm and friendly. He wound up playing a small but very important role in my development. I am no longer sure at this point if he recommended that I check out the American Studies program at the University of Minnesota, or if I found it on my own and asked his opinion. In either case, I developed an abiding interest in religious thought in his classes, and went up to Minneapolis to pursue it, with his encouragement. While I was there, I found myself attracted to theology, which led to my going to seminary, which eventually led to my becoming a no-account preacher in East Polka Paradise, Wisconsin. He gave me only the barest nudge in that direction, but it turned out to be just the push I needed. God provided the grease for the skids. I have no idea what Boyer’s religious commitments were, but he had a lot of respect for faith, and I think it would have pleased him to know how things turned out.

My condolences to his family and sincere appreciation for his life. He put it to good use.
