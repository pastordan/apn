First it was the smooth, daring, magisterial brass of John Coltrane’s The Africa Sessions. “Song of the Underground Railroad,” “Greensleeves,” “Africa.” It may have only made to the boombox playlist three or four times, but I carried the sound with me wherever I went for the better part of a month.

 Then it was the edgy, off-center melodies of The Threepenny Opera. I still haven’t dug out my tape of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s ode to the dissolution of the Weimar Republic, but I catch myself singing along at odd moments: in the car, in the shower, in a hospital corridor on the way to see a member of the congregation. My favorite bits seem to come from the troglodytic pub owner and evangelist Peachum:

> Awake, you ramshackle Christian souls:  
> Go on with your sinful employment;  
> Sell your own mother, you rogue,  
> Betray your own sister, you rat!  
> You think the Lord High God’s just a joke—  
> You’ll suffer his judgment for that…

But sometimes, it’s MacHeath’s beautiful—but suspect—declaration of love to Polly that comes to mind: For love will endure or not endure / Regardless of where we are…Perhaps you have to be able to hear Raul Julia’s sweet, almost breathtaking counter-tenor for that bit to make sense. It still amazes me to think that a man with that kind of talent ended his career with the Addams family and the big-screen adaptation of the Mario Brothers video game.

 I should be one to set myself up as an arbiter of taste, though. Almost as soon as I’d rediscovered the pleasures of The Threepenny Opera, I found it sharing mental airtime with Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols. The first song from the punk classic to come to mind was the jittery, metha-amphetamine driven “No Feelings,” but as soon as I found the tape, I remembered just how many crazed anthems the Pistols’ first album had bequeathed to pimply-faced suburban white punks such as myself: “Holidays in the Sun,” “Bodies” (which contains one of the greatest unprintable choruses of all rock ‘n’ roll), “Seventeen,” “God Save the Queen,” “Anarchy in the U.K.”. It’s not until well into the second half of the album that the speed and intensity level begins to drop, however slightly. God bless John Lydon. That little humpbacked screamer has made the world safe for all kinds of negative creeps ever since he bullied Malcolm McLaren into letting him into the band McLaren was forming with an illiterate cat-burglar for a guitarist and a rowdy petty thief as the drummer. The only professional was Glenn Matlock, the bassist, and they kicked him out in favor of the plug-ugly no-talent Sid Vicious.  

 Among the few songs I’m willing to quote to you are “God Save the Queen,” written for Elizabeth II’s Royal Jubilee in 1976:

> God save the Queen  
> She ain’t no human being  
> God save the Queen  
> ‘Cause tourists are money…  
> And there’s no future in England’s dreaming  
> No future, no future, no future for her  
> No future, no future, no future for me

and “Anarchy in the U.K.”:

> I am the Antichrist, I am an anarchist…  
> I wanna destroy, won’t stand by,  
> ‘Cause I—I wanna be anarchy…

 I’m not sure what’s driving me back to the music I used to listen to when I was nineteen. My first thought is to say that nineteen was a tough age for me, so I must be facing a similarly rough streak by taking shelter in the music that gave me comfort twelve years ago. But that can’t be the case. I also used to listen to stacks of soul, R&B, and reggae when I was nineteen, and I distinctly remember my pal Rob Skidmore offering to break an Elvis Costello record over my head if I listened to it one more time that day. So far, none of those old favorites has come back to haunt me in recent days.  
 Instead, I seem to have keyed into the music that I liked then and now for all the wrong reasons. Sure, Coltrane’s classy, even spiritual stuff. But he only lasted a couple of weeks, remember? The obsession with The Threepenny Opera and the Sex Pistols is an ongoing concern. It’s as though I had given up the beauty of Trane’s new spiritual horizons in favor of the closed and ugly room of pure punk energy:

> This is getting to be, this is getting to be, this is getting to be  
> Out of my reach  
> This is getting to be, this is getting to be, this is getting to be  
> Out of control  
> I’m a negative creep, I’m a negative creep, I’m a negative creep,  
> And I’m stoned

as Kurt Cobain once sang.

 I ain’t stoned, but I do worry sometimes that I’ve gone a bit negative. My parishioners worry sometimes about their pastor’s habit of blasting loud, strange music out of his truck windows. Somehow they never seem to notice when my radio’s tuned to classical music, but I guess I have no one but myself to blame. I can’t say that I’d recommend half my favorites to the members of the confirmation class—I’ve already got quite enough of a reputation for warping minds, thank you.

 So why do it? Why keep ahold of this ratty rock ‘n’ roll long after puberty has set in? Why not slip quietly off into country or some non-offensive jazz and just forget about punk?

 For a couple of reasons. One is that I am confronted daily with truly negative people. They grumble, they whine, they try to undermine me and one another. When that won’t work, they spit venom like cobras, snap and snarl and insult, whatever it takes to keep their community divided and their sense of self-justification intact. I try to love these folks, but it’s not easy. Being in community brings out the best and the worst in people, and it takes a strong constitution to wait the one out while developing the other. What I’ve found is that for me at least, listening to very angry music helps me to find a place to safely release my own anger. Father Mulcahy on M*A*S*H* took up boxing; I prefer to turn up Hüsker Dü’s Zen Arcade as loud as it will go when I can’t cope any more. That way, I’m a little less tempted to blow a gasket in a long and frustrating consistory meeting; think of it as dynamiting out space in my psyche which can then be filled up with the toxic sludge that accumulates in the life of every pastor.  
 The other reason to keep “flying the flannel” (remain true to my punk rock past), as strange as it might sound, has to do with a parrot. That same buddy who threatened to bust an Elvis Costello record over my head used to have a large, green-and-yellow macaw named Sam, and we all lived together for a year in college.

 Sam had a number of uneviable habits, such as going completely and astoundingly beserk every morning when the sun came up. This made us very unpopular with the neighbors in our apartment building. He would also crawl up your pant leg if you happened to be sitting on the couch; he was sure, just sure, that you would have some buttered toast or spaghetti in your lap. If he found it, the little thug would steal or extort it, all the while screaming at the top of his lungs and flapping his wings busily. If he didn’t find it, he’d scream at the top of his lungs and flap his wings busily—and bite your fingers. Little rat.

 More to the point, he would often join us in the shower. If you were silly enough to leave the bathroom door open even a crack, he’d flap his way in and perch himself high atop the shower nozzle, then proceed to give himself a bath by plunging his head under the running water. It was here that things got truly dangerous. If he fell into the tub with you, he’d force his way out, not caring what damage he did to the shower curtain or to you. Since we were generally soaped up and defenseless, this was not a very popular pastime of Sam’s.

 One morning, he flew into Rob’s shower and managed to get himself thoroughly soaked. And, if you’ve not seen a half-drowned macaw attempt to fly, let me assure you that it ruins their aerodynamics completely. I’ll never forget watching him cross the living room to the sunny windows facing north: glide, thump; glide, thump. Once perched on the windowsill, he proceeded to go berserk once again, cawing like—well, honestly, like some demented parrot Sex Pistol. Our fourth roommate Charles Clover awoke from his slumber and declared that he was going to the library to study Arabic. Charles always did know how to pick his battles.

 When Rob came out of the shower, Sam was still in fine voice. I remarked that he didn’t seem to know whether he was happy or really, deeply pissed off.

 “Don’t think it makes much difference,” Rob shrugged. “His brain isn’t that big.”

 Which is about where I leave it with the old opera and punk music. It doesn’t matter so much whether it makes me happy or angry; like the water running off Sam’s feathers, it just gives me energy, and the sense that there’s something worth shouting about. That’s of no small consolation when you’re like me, and tend to react to a stretch of bad luck by curling up on your recliner and more or less going catatonic. I haven’t had the energy to clean my house in three weeks, much less try to deal with my problems. But slowly, things are coming back—the house is clean, if nothing else. So raise up that black flag, you rebel children, and blazon it with the Sacred Heart of Mary—the punk rock pastor’s getting his groove back, and before you know it, he’ll be ready for the next slam-dance.
