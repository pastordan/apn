[Acts 2:39 & Mark 10:13-16](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=306749806)

Because we are having a baptism this morning, along with communion, I decided that I would keep the sermon short today. I also decided to keep the liturgy short, and did such a good job that there’s some remote possibility that we’ll be done with church early.

You can all stop clapping now.

We already know most of what there is to be said about the scripture we just heard. The promise of God’s salvation is for not just us, the adult people of God, but for our children as well. There is no sign that reads “You must be this tall to receive redemption.”

Nor is there a sign that says “You must be a member of this family to be loved by God.” In Jesus’ day, that meant as we have heard that you didn’t need to be born into the Jewish family in order to be saved by Christ’s death on the cross, nor to receive the promise of life everlasting given in his resurrection. In our time, it means that there is no one special form of family required to be a child of God. Black, white, two mommies, two daddies, Grandma and Grandpa, single mother, single father, divorced parent: no child will be denied the cleansing and healing waters of baptism. No child will be denied the love of God in Christ Jesus. Not while I’m the pastor.

Because, as it happens, Christ kind of liked kids. He told his disciples to let the children through to see him, without hindrance. “It is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs,” he says.

Probably, this story is a metaphor. “Little children” represent disciples of simple faith, whom Jesus teaches his followers to accept just the way they are. Don’t be snobs, he says. Don’t be like adults who can’t be bothered by little kids. Everybody is welcome. Everybody.

That everybody does include actual little children, of course. According to Jesus we should welcome them into our midst as equals. [At this point, the baby let out a little cry. He agreed.] More than that: we should imitate how they welcome the kingdom: as something they cannot fully grasp or understand, but which is wonderful nonetheless, because it is filled with the love of a parent for his children. Kids know when something is done out of love.

[Jean Vanier, founder of L’Arche communities ](http://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/god-chooses-despised-interview-2015-templeton-prize-laureate-jean-vanier)worldwide, had this to say about people with developmental disabilities. I think it applies to children too:

> They have beautiful hearts, they don’t have big heads, they’re not people who want to know things. What they want to know is: “Do you love me?” Maybe that is what we all want to know: “Do you love me?” Maybe that is the heart of the Christian message: that Jesus loves us and therein is our joy. That is what people with disabilities reveal to us. That is the only one important thing; that it be revealed that Jesus loves me.

When asked to define love, Vanier responded that it “the secret of love is to reveal to someone that ‘you are precious,’ that ‘you are beautiful,” that “you have value.”

That sounds to me at least like what parents spend an awful lot of time doing for their children. The unexpected part of our lesson comes at the end, where Jesus “took the children up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.” Though I can’t say that I have researched ancient Jewish social customs enough to prove the point, it seems to me that Jesus is acting very much like a father to these children. It’s typically the Jewish father’s job to bless the children, after all, and I can’t imagine that it was ordinary in Jesus’ day for men to touch children they didn’t know, much less pick them up and hug them.

But Jesus does. He loves the little children like they were his own, and so does God.

That continues today. God loves children as though they were his own. God loves *you* as though you were his own, no matter how young or old you are.

There is something tender about this affection, something loving gentle, and intimate. You know how you sort of melt inside when you get to hold a baby? That’s how God feels about you.

Holding, touching, is very much a part of it. Jesus *takes* the children up into his arms, he *lays* his hands on them. All this week I’ve been thinking about how important touching is to my work, to the life of the church, really. We hold hands to pray. We make the sign of the cross for healing, sometimes with ashes, sometimes with oil. We shake hands to pass the peace, and if you don’t like that custom, remember that it used to be a kiss of peace, not a handshake. We hug. And of course, we hold the baby for the baptism.

Which brings us to where our focus really ought to be this morning, on TJ.

In a minute, I mean to take TJ and do what he probably will not allow too many people in his life to do: hold him in my arms and drop cool water on his forehead. Though it will be my hands and my arms doing the work, they will only be signs, symbols of what is really going on. God is reaching out across the farthest distances to touch TJ with a gentle, loving, reassuring touch, like a parent for a child. He does that for TJ, and for all of us. To us the Kingdom belongs, if we are willing to receive it as children do. If, in other words, we are willing to accept the love of God in Christ Jesus, given without condition in baptism and all throughout our lives. Let Jesus take you up in his arms. Let him lay his hands on you. Let him bless you, and love you, now and always. Amen.
