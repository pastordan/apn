Be brief this week. It’s been a long one, and you’re tired. Nothing serious, nothing that twelve hours of sleep and an ice cream sundae wouldn’t fix. But still, it’s been a week, and you least of anybody need to hear yourself go off on some enormous flight of fancy this Thursday. So stick to the message, don’t answer any pop questions on the leadership of Pakistan, and for God’s sake, don’t discuss any youthful indiscretions without talking to your handlers first.

 I saw a cardinal the other day, perched in a thicket above a stream. In itself, this is hardly an unusual occurrence. But this was a warm fall day, dry, with rumors of winter circling about in the breeze. In my mind, at least, you see cardinals on moist spring mornings, when the wind blows seemingly straight off the Gulf of Mexico, and the first earthworms are wriggling, should you care to turn over a shovelful of dirt and dead leaves. A friend told me once that cardinals don’t migrate. In fact, they are somewhat territorial birds, and remain in a fairly limited area for most of their lives. The next time I was home, I looked it up in our field guide, and I think (but won’t swear) that it said he was right. Ever since then, I have checked the trees in midwinter, and been rewarded with the occasional flash of red amongst all the browns and grays. Even the magnolias of Georgia of a rainy day in January would occasionally reveal the odd hidden bird. It always made me wonder if I’d been missing something in summer and fall. Where do cardinals go when I’m not around to watch them?

 Regardless of where the other members of his specie had gotten themselves to, this particular cardinal had parked himself behind a Friendly’s restaurant in Lancaster, PA. I don’t know why, but it seemed an odd place to find a cardinal. I wouldn’t have been more surprised to discover a coyote or a great blue heron back of the dumpster. This little fellow symbolized something unexpected, something of the wild fighting back against our dreary commercial civilization, and winning. The stream behind Friendly’s has been liberated!

 I looked around as I climbed in the truck, and realized that I was probably the only person who would see—or notice, at least—this funny little revolutionary. It put me in mind of a story told in church by a journalist friend in Minneapolis. This man had been assigned to write a series of articles on the Great Plains of the United States, and spent several weeks dutifully driving himself through the huge emptiness of the Dakotas, Wyoming and Nebraska. One of the pleasures of the trip, he told the congregation, was that there was very little to interrupt the spectacular sunrises and sunsets. The journalist was so overwhelmed by the solar beauty he was graced with that, as he pulled away from his hotel each morning, he would utter aloud a simple “Thank you.” After several days of this, it occurred to him that when he said this, he was speaking to no one other than God. In that simple act of thanksgiving, he said, he learned what true worship—and the true presence of God—was like.

 This was how I felt when I saw my unexpected cardinal. I too wanted to say “Thank you” to someone. And so I do: Thank you, God, or whoever it was that put that bird in my way.

 In honor of the Penn Central Conference Evangelism Ministry Team joining the APN e-mail list, I thought I would put forward a knotty question that I’ve had stored away for some time now. It comes from real life, I assure you.

 A man moves into a community and joins the local Lutheran church. Soon thereafter, it comes out that he is on a list of registered sex offenders as a paroled child molester. While this information is known to the pastor and a few people in the church, it is not widely known either in the community or in the congregation. At the next meeting of the governing board (Lutherans, what do you call this body?), the topic comes up, and a motion is made to remove the man from the church. What do you do?

 I am not so interested here in the legal or ethical niceties as in your gut reaction—and subsequent follow-up. Even more, and this is why I dedicate the question to the Evangelism Team, I wonder how one brings the Good News *both to this man and to the congregation*. Responses, please.

 N.B.: There will be no Pastor’s Notebook next week. I will be on the beach in Delaware, letting my mind go soft, and trying not to think of the sermon I’ll have to preach that Sunday. I suggest you do the same. Only in your own state. And not on the beach. And while you’re at it, could you write that sermon for me?
