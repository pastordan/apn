I get [press releases](http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/5069019029.html). This one plumps the memoir written by a psychiatrist’s wife, looking back on raising a family on the grounds of Norristown State Mental Hospital in Pennsylvania:

> But what is not funny about any of this is that Jaeger was able to chronicle how living amongst the truly insane affected her and her family.  Witnessing the decay of the mental health system — as Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society socialized medicine across America — Jaeger was only able to survive with the help of Jesus Christ.
> 
> “Five Strolled Into Madness,” an instant best-seller, has been published by Publish America and is available in bookstores and at Amazon.com.  Based on a true story, “Five” shows a view of the mental health system rarely seen in Establishment books thanks to the Frankfurt School’s “march through the institutions,” a propaganda scheme first proposed by the political philosopher, Herbert Marcuse, to supplant traditional Christian values with cultural Marxism, also known as “political correctness.”

Holy epistemic closure. There’s a real conversation in there somewhere, but it’s been through the conservative echo chamber God knows how many times, with each iteration further and further from anything resembling the world I live in, anyway.

And can anyone tell me what on earth any of this has to do with any kind of faith Jesus the man of Nazareth would recognize?
