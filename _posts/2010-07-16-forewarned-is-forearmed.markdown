The book gets its first notice at the [God’s Politics blog](http://blog.sojo.net/2010/07/15/changing-the-script-on-political-theology/), of all places:

The promises that military might could keep us safe and unfettered capitalistic consumerism could keep us happy died ignominious deaths under President Bush. We — people of faith — need to help our fellow citizens understand that militarism and consumerism are deader than doornails. You’re not going to get rich speculating in real estate or on stocks, and killing untold thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan isn’t going to keep you safe. But life is possible without those things. Real happiness, real joy, comes from being content with our lot and living responsibly in community, broadly drawn. Real safety comes from living a reconciled life with neighbors, down the block and around the world.</div><div style="color: black; font: normal normal normal 12px/17px Verdana; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 5px; vertical-align: middle;">The guarantor of those promises is God, and God always delivers on her promises, though often in surprising and disconcerting ways. Bottom line: it ain’t over until it’s over. God’s got more in store for you, so get happy — and hold on to your hat.</div>
