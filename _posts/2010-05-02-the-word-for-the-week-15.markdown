[Acts 11:1-18](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=139826137)

I have been feeling provoked by scripture lately. Last week, if you will recall, we talked about Peter’s healing of Dorcas, just before he begins the Gentile mission with the Roman centurion Cornelius. I argued in that sermon that the power of God’s love raised Dorcas from the dead—but it was also that same love that propelled Peter out into the world.

This week, we return to the book of Acts, but on the other side of Peter’s visit with Cornelius. He’s gone and converted Cornelius’ household, and now he has to defend his actions before his critics back home in Jerusalem.

Now, you should know: Peter’s critics have something of a point.   
[]()We are conditioned to hear rules and regulations as oppressive, but they also give structure and identity to community. To put it another way, the critics are asking Peter: if we throw the Jewish rules out the window, who are we? The answer the church comes up with eventually is that the Jewish Christians follow Jewish law, but converts can be admitted by observing a few basic rules.

We’re not quite there yet. Peter’s response at the moment runs along these lines: I had a vision, some of you were there with me and didn’t object then, and who am I to stand in the way of God’s power when gives the Holy Spirit?

To which his critics respond: “Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.” That sounds like “Oh good, they get to feel bad about themselves too,” but that’s really not it. As William Willimon points out, what they’re really talking about is *conversion*, or redirecting one’s entire life to God. That’s not something we can do for ourselves. God has to point us in the right direction. Jews at this time thought God did that through the law, so now Peter’s critics are marveling that not only has God apparently chosen to reach out to a new people, he’s chosen to do it in a new way.

So if we are united in Christ, it is unity in the common gift of repentance. God has given us all the opportunity to turn our lives around, in other words. It would be very easy to preach from this a broad message of universalism. God says the power of his grace is available to all people! Who are we to hinder the power of God?

That’s a great message—in general. But when you get down to specifics, things get very difficult. We’ll hear more about that kind of problem a little later in the book of Acts, when Paul begins to draw followers who aren’t as eager to follow the Jewish laws as some of the other converts.

In our own time and place, we like to say that we as a church are welcoming to all people, that we are “the little church with the open arms.” And so we are. But what you find out is that unless you spell out the specifics, people don’t really trust statements like that. Sure, you *say* you’re open to all people, but do you mean it? Because there are an awful lot of church that say they’re open, but when somebody black or Hispanic or openly gay shows up, they turn out not to be so accepting after all. So you have to “put up” by saying specifically: yes, we’re open to people of other races, we’re open to people who don’t speak English as their first language, we’re open to people who are gay or lesbian or bisexual or trans-gender.

Trouble is, the more specific you get, the more potential you have for, well, trouble. Our first congregation in Pennsylvania had a very difficult time opening up to Hispanics because they felt like they had been chased out of their old building by Puerto Rican immigrants. (Getting firebombed will do that.) Or maybe somebody just can’t go there with gays and lesbians. I imagine, but do not really know, that that might be the sticking point for us.

And as someone pointed out to me, it’s not like most of us go around saying, “Hey, I’m straight.” Now, it’s not like gay folks always want to push their identity in your face, either. Really, what they’d like is to talk openly about who they love, same as anyone else. But yes, at a certain point, you have to ask when celebrating everyone’s particulars takes the focus off the generalities that connect us. I’ve even met some gay folks who have left congregations because they didn’t want a “gay church,” they wanted a church, period.

Then too focusing on being welcoming to certain groups of people can cause us to forget about our individual responsibilities. You might be perfectly happy to sit in church with with Hispanics or gays or what have you, but if you’re muttering under your breath the entire time about how you can’t stand the hymn selection, how welcoming is that, really?

All of this is a tangle, and I know it must seem like we’re getting away from this morning’s scripture. But I believe that part of the message that Acts has for us is that the church, God’s beloved community, is called to hear God’s word and apply it to just such messes. Deciding who we are and who we can accept as part of our community isn’t a distraction, in other words. It’s part of our core work.

I mentioned at the beginning of this sermon that I was feeling provoked by scripture. The provocation is this: I feel compelled to ask you all where you are at on the subject of openness. I think that we have general agreement that we want to be “the little church with the open arms.” But first, are we ready to start talking about what that might mean, and how we might communicate it? And second, where are you on what it means? Feel free to share your thoughts with me—politely—after worship.

I’ve gone on too long as it is, but I want to close with a couple more thoughts. The first is to repeat a saying from the German theologian [Dietrich Bonhoeffer](http://ceruleansanctum.com/2010/04/a-ministry-that-flows-from-love-for-god-and-people.html):

> If you love the vision you have for community, you will destroy community. [But] if you love the people around you, you will create community.

That’s Peter’s bottom-line message. I know, he says, what our community is supposed to look like. But I also know that there are people out there who need us, and God is apparently sending us out to them. That’s Peter’s bottom line, and I think it’s ours too.

Second and at long last, the one thing we can be sure of as we work our way through these questions is that God will guide us on our way. If we trust him to lead us by the power of his love, through the Holy Spirit, then I am confident that just as God guided the church in Acts, so too God will turn us toward him, and toward the new life he has promised to us. That may call for us to have some potentially uncomfortable conversations, but by the grace of God, we will enter into the future he has chosen for us and so become who we need to be. Amen.
