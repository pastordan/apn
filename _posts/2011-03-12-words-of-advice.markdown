The [Kettle Community Writers Guild](http://kcwriters.wordpress.com/) graciously invited me to speak on a panel at a workshop this morning based on the theme “There’s No Reason Not To Write.”

I had a nice talk worked out that I didn’t give, because they asked us a series of questions rather than have us make a presentation. It made for a nice conversation. I hate to let things go to waste, so here is a rough translation of what I had in my head:

> I have to disagree to some extent with the premise we have been asked to speak on. It turns out that there are plenty of reasons not to write, some of them pretty good. Back in 2004, my denomination released its God is Still Speaking advertising campaign, which generated some “controversy” when CBS and NBC refused to run the ads. The UCC likes new media, so they scheduled a conference call with bloggers to help them break the story. As it happened, the call came on the same day that my wife had taken off from work to help me bake Christmas cookies for our church’s annual Cookie Walk. I was upstairs listening in to the call and writing the story up while she started work in the kitchen.I’m working on this story, working and working, and Jen is downstairs getting more and more irritated with my absence. She finally loses patience and comes upstairs with an ultimatum: “Either you come downstairs this instant, or I am going to leave the cookies *that I am baking for your church* in the oven, and I am walking out the door!”
> 
> I tell my online friends, I gotta go. They reply: “Go! Save the cookies!”
> 
> My wife has almost forgiven me for this incident, seven years later.
> 
> So yes, there are many good reasons not to write. We all have basements and garages to clean, children to raise, husbands and wives to attend, cookies to bake. The consequences for writing instead of getting these things done can be severe, up to and including (in rough order of severity): 

> - Divorce
> - Death
> - Dismemberment
> - Alcoholism
> - War
> - Rumors of War
> - Estrangement from Children
> - Decreased libido
> - *Increased* libido
> - Hairy palms
> - Ecstatic union with the divine
> - Transfiguration
> - Transmogrification
> - Resemblance to Garrison Keillor (accidental, intentional, passing or imagined)
> - Poetry
> - Failure
> - Success, and
> - Loss of Christmas cookies
> 
> But the last, worst consequence of writing, and the best reason not to write, is the blank page. An empty page never forgives and never forgets. It just sits there, silently, accusingly.
> 
> What you have to figure out, then, is not that there is no reason not to write, but that there is no reason not to write *this*. Because if you can write *this*, even the tiniest scrap of text, you will have beat the rap of the blank page.
> 
> It takes a lot of fertilizer to get that garden to grow. You’ve got to read and read and write little notes that turn into bigger notes and then paragraphs. Eventually, with some luck and some—ahem—organic material sprinkled liberally, you wind up with enough stuff that there seems like no reason not to write, because you’re halfway done or better.
> 
> It all begins, as I say, with some fertilizer. I recommend printing out this post on recycled organic paper using soy-based inks. Burn it, add it to the compost pile along with such Christmas cookies as you are able to salvage, and spread it on your roses in the spring. You might as well get *some* use out of it.
