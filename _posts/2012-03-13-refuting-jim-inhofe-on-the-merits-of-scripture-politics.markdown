Seeing this [theological take-down of Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/senator-inhofes-theological-conundrum/2012/03/12/gIQAxf4l7R_blog.html) reminds me that I never did get around to posting my own rebuttal, posted on Twitter last Friday. Let’s remedy that.

First, however, let me preface this “twermon” by saying that reading scripture in context seldom convinces fundamentalists to change their views, and it *never* changes the minds of dogmatic conservatives with an ideological ax to grind. I long ago gave up on the silly idea that Christians could win debates with political opponents through the use of superior scriptural arguments. The Bible, as a rule, gets dragged into the argument after the conclusion has been made, all protests to the contrary notwithstanding. Therefore, the purpose of these little lessons is so that you know what’s really what, gentle reader, not “them.”

To begin, then: [Jim Inhofe is flogging a new book skeptical of climate change](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/james-inhofe-says-bible-refutes-climate-change), which is a long-time crusade of his.

Inhofe cites [Genesis 8:22](http://t.co/lTo6Pd5Z) as supporting his claim that humans cannot alter God’s creation. But if you actually read the passage, you discover that it’s not about the climate at all. It’s about God withholding ultimate judgment on humankind. God will not blot out the earth or its inhabitants: “I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, although the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth: nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.”

Then comes the part Inhofe cites: “As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease.” In other words, as long as there is a world, you’re safe. God is forgiving and faithful to his creation. There is nothing, utterly nothing, here about humanity not being able to destroy creation, only God foreswearing the intent to blow it up.

(As a side note, the point of the flood narrative is to show how YHWH is different from other gods who *did* destroy everything. But it also sets up the Exodus narrative. The same God who is loving and faithful in creation will free his children from slavery. And all of this comes about in context of exile, where both Genesis and Exodus narratives are written down. It’s not entirely accurate to say Genesis is “fiction” meant to comfort Jews in Babylonian exile. It’s more like a collective memory/narrative, facts notwithstanding.)

If you look at the very next chapter of Genesis, only a few verses beyond Inhofe’s quotes, you see this: “I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants…I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood.” So perhaps if you’re a biblical literalist, you might conclude that rising ocean levels won’t destroy us. Fine. The point of the passage, however, is that *every living creature* is covered by the covenant, no exceptions. Therefore, suck it haters. Gay people aren’t going to make the world come to an end. And God refuses to be the god of wrath, preferring to be the giver and keeper of promises.

Inhofe also quotes [Romans 1:25](http://t.co/XJbDj35X) to hack and slash at Christians who, you know, actually care about the climate. Read in context, this is indeed a passage about divine judgment, in this case about people who prefer to worship idols in the form of animals, rather than the invisible Jewish God. In other words, standard procedure in the pagan world around Paul. The idols–not creation itself–are what Paul has in mind when he criticizes the idolaters.

As long as we’re talking about judgment, Paul goes on to castigate common sexual practices of the day, i.e., male homosexuality. Jews, unlike the Greeks, abhorred homosexuality, and Paul never wraps his head around any other way of looking at things.* But—and this is an important but—Paul’s point is that “God gave them up” to the error of their ways. In other words, some people choose to be dumbwads. Shrug. Bottom line: unless Inhofe can show liberals bowing down before graven images of the environment, he should pipe down. And even if he could demonstrate such a thing, Paul’s message is pretty clear: it’s not up to Christians to judge other’s mistakes. Rather, knowing The Truth, we’re meant to be about our own business, which is love and acceptance of others.

One more thing: Paul was very definitely writing to a contemporary situation, and this argument is a piece of it, helping the church in Rome understand where Christians fit into the Jewish “salvation narrative.” His point is first that the Jewish God is continuous with the revelation in Christ, and second, that this revelation provides a meaningful alternative to destructive and prevailing mores of his day. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to say for sure how Paul would have responded to today’s climate change situation. But my hunch is that he would tell Inhofe not to drag God in as cover for greed and bloody-minded exploitation. I also suspect that he’d be baffled by Inhofe citing him as predicting the current situation. Paul never speaks of himself as a prophet, and it’s not because he’s shy about claiming titles for himself. Prophecy has more to do with imagination than prediction, anyway.

In conclusion, I’ll give Inhofe a B- on interpretation and a hearty bite my shiny metal a–. His interpretation is wrong, but not outrageously so, but his application of the texts is, well, lacking.

When I tweeted all of this the other day, some folks were worried about legislating from the Bible, and rightly so. I bracket those concerns out in order to concentrate on the scriptural interpretation. I’m a pastor, that’s what I do.

However, I do have my views on the separation of church and state. Spoiler alert: it’s a good thing. I believe that it’s okay to bring religious perspectives into the public square—it should be encouraged, in fact.

So sure, if you want to cite the Bible for your crazy-ass positions, go ahead. Be prepared to defend your interpretation, though, and be prepared to hear that not everyone shares your perspectives. Along those lines, religious perspectives are fine for informing the morals you bring to the table. As much as I don’t care for the position, if you think the Bible prohibits marriage equality, by all means, go ahead and say that. But you also need to provide a compelling reason for those who disagree with your *moral* perspective to agree with your *policy*. All of which is to say, “legislating from the Bible” is admissible, but not sufficient.

The real concern, I think, is making a particular interpretation or religious teaching a “trump card” in public debate. That is to say, if the Catholic bishops want to say scripture teaches that birth control is evil, that’s their right. But unless they can demonstrate that there’s a good reason for non-Catholics to accept that view, no, it shouldn’t be normative. This has long been my argument about marriage equality. Why is it that Catholic, Mormon and Baptist views on marriage should be preferable to those of many congregations in my own UCC? The short answer is that there’s no good reason, and certainly no reason why the government that represents both religious and non-religious citizens should.

One last thing about all of this. The Bible is *not* a textbook, is not a scientific journal, is not a legal handbook. Let it be what it is, and you might find that it has a whole lot more to say to you than making it “God’s little answer book.”
