[The non-religious are the least “pro-life.”](http://www.christianpost.com/news/gallup-nonreligious-are-least-pro-life-75772/) Also, water is wet, it’s warm in July and the Chicago Cubs suck.

Still. Too.

> <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">Gallup also found that men are more pro-life than women, nonwhites are more pro-life than whites, those 55 and older are more pro-life than 18- to 54-year-olds, Southerners are more pro-life than non-Southerners, and those who make less than $75,000 per year are more pro-life than upper-income Americans.</span>
