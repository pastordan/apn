I was pleased with how last night’s sermon turned out, hope you were too. This post by Derek Penwell at—yes—Dmergent was very helpful in shaping my argument:

> [Welcoming Gay People: Why It’s a Conversation You Need to Have](http://dmergent.org/2012/02/27/welcoming-gay-people-why-its-a-conversation-you-need-to-have/)
> 
> These are pastors who, on an individual level, believe that LGBTQ people ought to be welcomed into the life of the church without any qualification of the kinds of ministry or service in which they might engage. That is to say, these pastors are sympathetic to the idea of Open and Affirming as a move the church needs to make … some day down the road. They’re “just not there yet.” If “we’re just not there yet” describes your congregation, this post is for you.

Read it. I probably would have gotten there on my own, but Penwell helped me get there quicker and cleaner.
