What a coincidence. So do I! So go [here](http://www.getmyfbifile.com/), follow the instructions, and have the FBI (or NSA, CIA, and so on) print our your file. Then send it to me (don’t forget to include plenty of postage), and I’ll tell you what color hat you were wearing the last time you went to see Lord of the Rings.
