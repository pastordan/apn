Apparently, I’m going to continue writing and posting various prayers and liturgies here. It really does seem to be something of an emerging call for me.

Eventually, I’ll get around to giving all of this stuff its own page so it’s easier to find. I will also place a notice there, to this effect: please feel free to use and/or adapt any material you might find here. That’s what it’s there for. You don’t even have to give me credit in your bulletin. Just–out of politeness, if nothing else–don’t pretend it’s yours, and don’t try to sell it. That’s not so hard, is it?
