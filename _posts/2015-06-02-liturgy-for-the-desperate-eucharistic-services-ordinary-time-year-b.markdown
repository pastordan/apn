Invitation

When they found him, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.”

So they said to him, “Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'” Then Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”

*or*

Let all people enter into the joy of the Lord!  
You who are rich and you the poor, come to the feast  
receive the riches of God’s loving-kindness.  
And let no one mourn his poverty,  
for the universal kingdom has been revealed.

Great Prayer

The Lord be with you.  
**And also with you.**

Lift up your hearts.  
**We lift them up to the Lord.**

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.  
**It is right to give him thanks and praise.**

It is indeed right and good to give you thanks and praise, always and everywhere, almighty God and everlasting Father, through Jesus Christ your Son.

From the moment of our ancestors Adam and Eve you created us good and for the good of the world, in your image and carrying within us the light of your Spirit.

In your Son Jesus Christ our Lord, you have overcome all division and alienation. You have restored us both body and soul from death to life and recovered our true selves.

[You who are rich in mercy, out of the great love with which you have loved us, have made us alive together with him: by grace we have been saved.]

By [that] grace we are once more what you have made us, created in Christ Jesus for the good works that you prepared to be our way of life.

United in his Holy Spirit, we have access to you, empowered as citizens in the kingdom that comes into the world, loved as members of your heavenly family, sent out as good news to the poor, comfort to the broken-hearted, freedom to the captives and release to the prisoners.

And so with all the saints throughout time and the choirs of Heaven, we lift our voices up to you:

**Holy, holy, holy, God of love and majesty, **  
**The whole universe speaks of your glory,  O God Most High.**  
** Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!**

Remembrance

We remember with joyful thanksgiving the infinite ways your creation reveals your love for us. And we remember that in the superabundance of your love you sent to us Jesus, the man of Nazareth, to be our redeemer and our salvation.

We recall that on the night before he gave himself for the life of the world, our brother Jesus took a loaf + of bread. When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, ‘This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way he took the cup also, + after supper, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.’

Therefore, we proclaim the mystery of faith:

**We proclaim your Death, O Lord,**  
**and profess your Resurrection,**  
**until you come again.**

*or*

**Save us, Savior of the world,**  
**for by your Cross and Resurrection**  
**you have set us free.**

Loving God, who fills all in all, come down from heaven and give us the bread that gives life to the world. Send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts of bread and wine that they may be everlasting life for us, the body and blood of Jesus Christ our savior.

Through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all honor and glory are yours, O God, now and forever. **Amen.**

Invitation to the table

Those who eat Christ’s body and drink his blood live in him and he in them. Come, receive the bread and the wine and the new life that comes through them.

*or*

Receive the body of Christ, taste the fountain of everlasting life.

*The body of Christ, bread of heaven.*  
*The blood of Christ, the cup of salvation.*

Thanksgiving

God of grace and mercy, we give you thanks for revealing to us your love in this sacrament and in the sacrament of the creation. As you have nourished us at this table, so feed us with your presence as we go forth from it that we may testify to your steadfast kindness to the world around us. For we pray to you in the name of your son our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the power of his Holy Spirit. **Amen.**

*or*

At this table, we have known the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, and been filled with all the fullness of God.

Now to God who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to God be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. **Amen.**
