At my sister’s request, here is my version of James’ Beard’s recipe for “Cuban” bread. It’s not really Cuban, more French or something.

*Anyway*.

**Ingredients**

- 2 cups warm water
- 1½ tablespoon yeast
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 5-6 cups flour

Combine the water (a little warmer than baby’s bath), yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let sit for a few minutes, until it begins to get foamy. Add flour one cup at a time, until you have a firm but not sticky dough. I like to use half regular bread flour and half King Arthur Flour; it gives a nice lift to the bread without getting too expensive.

After the first cup or two, add in the salt. (You can also mix it into the flour itself, but it’s not necessary. Just don’t put it in with the yeast and water—you’ll kill the yeast.)

Once the dough is mixed, knead for about 10 minutes. Put it in a buttered bowl, cover, and set it aside in a warm place for 1½-2 hours.

After the dough has risen, you have options. You can gently deflate the dough and let it rise again for another hour. Or if you’re pressed for time, you can skip directly to the next step.

Cut the dough ball in half and form into loaves. I typically make French baguette-style loaves and twist them a few times for an interesting shape, but any style works. Let the dough recover for 20-30 minutes.

Another optional step: beat an egg in ¼ cold water and brush over the top of the loaves.

Place the loaves in a **cold** oven. Set to 400°. Bake for 35 minutes or so, until the loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. You may have to turn them over for the last 10 minutes or so. Let them cool thoroughly, if you can resist them, then tear into them with a savage and butter-fueled fury.
