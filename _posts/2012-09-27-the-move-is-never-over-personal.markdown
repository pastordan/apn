title: The Move Is Never Over [Personal]

We have been sleeping a strange, guilt-free sleep the past few nights. There are no motorcycles to invade our dreams, no farm equipment, no noisy bars or rowdy young neighbors hitting us with the bass after midnight.

Yes, dear friends, we have moved to the city, and we are enjoying the peace and quiet. The loudest it’s gotten in our apartment complex was the first afternoon, when a kid zoomed below our window with a Segway.

Who drives a Segway?

Anyway, as you may have heard, we live behind the mall in Fond du Lac. [This mall](https://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&q=forest+mall+fond+du+lac&fb=1&gl=us&hq=forest+mall+fond+du+lac&hnear=forest+mall+fond+du+lac&cid=0,0,2278550965988567946&ei=hL5jUPquAcfaywHrhIGgCw&ved=0CH4Q_BIwBw). More properly, we live behind the St. Vinnie’s behind the mall in Fond du Lac, north of Johnson Street—FDL’s main artery—and east of US Highway 41, the all-but-interstate that connects Milwaukee, Oshkosh-Appleton, and Green Bay. Surprisingly, it really *is* quiet here. I don’t know if it’s intentional or not, but the other buildings seem to block a lot of the traffic noise. And the rent is high enough to keep out the—ahem—*party-oriented* types. Mostly it seems like it’s families, a few singles, and retirees. One of the latter put a couple of Band-Aids on Bill’s knee when he fell off his bike this afternoon.

We have a two-bedroom upper unit. There’s a one-car garage downstairs, which we’ve taken to calling “the basement,” because we have it crammed full of spare furniture and other stuff. We’re not alone in that: I’d say only a third of the bays are filled with actual automobiles. The rest look like something you’d see on “Pawn Stars,” or are furnished with sofas, screen doors, and fridges. A lot of those retirees like to hang out and smoke.

The stairs lead up to our dining area. To the right is the kitchen; make a u-turn, and there’s a living room with a nook coming off it. A door from the nook leads to our porch or balcony, just big enough for a couple of chairs and a little table. On the other side of the railing, there’s a maple tree, close enough to reach out and touch. Between the kitchen and the living room, there’s a little hall which separates Bill’s room from his bathroom. At the end is the master suite, such as it is, with two closets and its own bath. And that’s our little world.

It’s surprisingly homey, especially now that we’ve been able to put some things away. We managed to cram two big bookcases in the living room, my computer and a small desk in the nook. We even fit a smaller bookcase into one of the closets, which allowed me to bring my comic books out of boxes. We’re starting to put things up on the wall, and the boxes are shrinking little by little.

Don’t be fooled. The move is not over. The move is never over. We started cleaning things out back in June, back when we first found out my ministry was coming to an end. It continued through packing our things in the fall and a quick trip after class to drop off the few things of Abbey’s we were keeping for her at her foster home. That was a strange thing. When I pulled up to the house, the kitchen door was open and the dogs were in the yard, requesting attention. There were three of them: a mastiff who slobbered on my arm and pants, and two mutts who brought me a flattened and well-chewed frisbee to toss for them. But no one answered when I rang the doorbell, so I set Abbey’s things on the porch and left a voicemail for her foster mother. I heard later that they were away for a few days, but nothing about what happened to her things, or about the house being open. I assume it was nothing more than a simple miscommunication, but it’s the sort of detail that nags at me.

We cleaned up our old house the other night, sweeping and mopping and wiping with the heat turned down and the purple of night deepening around us. I still have to sweep off the back porch, clean out a few things from the garage, maybe one or two other things. There are plenty of pictures left to hang, plenty of plastic bins to put away. I still have to organize my desk, as Mrs. Pastor would happy—happy!—to remind you.

On one level, the issues we’ve had this far haven’t had as much to do with apartment living as adjusting to it. The parsonage was almost twice the size of the new place, but we don’t seem to miss the space. Ask me again about that come January or February. We haven’t quite figured out the necessary dance in the kitchen, or how to maneuver when we’re getting ready in the morning. The dishes don’t all fit in the dishwasher. The folding doors don’t quite shut on the closet where the washer and dryer live. We have quite a lot of furniture in the garage. But the fact is that there *is* a dishwasher, and a washer and a dryer, and a garage that holds furniture, kayaks, bikes, a chest freezer, Christmas decorations, luggage, and God knows what else. If you need some closet organizers, make us an offer.

Meanwhile, it sounds stupid, but we’re enjoying being close to work, shops, restaurants and everything else. We adjusted to being in the country pretty easily, but now we love getting to Target in two minutes and the grocery store in three. We drop Bill off at school at 8, come back for him at 3, and work like hell in between. And that’s our day.

Ask me about all of this in a few months. We still have a slew of worries left to worry: about work and money and ultimate destiny. We still have to get through my last day at church. The emotional move, like the physical one, is all but—yet not quite—done. The details still nag at me. I’ll write more about that another time. For right now, we have a safe, simple place to live, and all I have to do to keep it is teach a couple of classes and shovel out the cars come winter. I sleep fine. That will do.
