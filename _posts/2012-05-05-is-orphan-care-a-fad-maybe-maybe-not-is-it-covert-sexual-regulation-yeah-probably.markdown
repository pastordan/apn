title: Is "Orphan Care" A Fad? Maybe, Maybe Not. Is It Covert Sexual Regulation? Yeah,
  Probably

In the past, I’ve praised [Evangelical initiatives to promote adoption](http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/danielschultz/4239/evangelicals_and_%E2%80%9Corphan_care%E2%80%9D) as laudable efforts to fill a real—there *are* a lot of kids out there in need of a loving, stable family—but stuff like this from a recent [Orphan Care “summit”](http://www.christianpost.com/news/pastor-crawford-loritts-caring-for-orphans-is-heart-of-god-not-a-fad-74346/) continues to bug me:

> Saddlback [sic] Church lead pastor Rick Warren also took part in the opening session on Thursday by reading from the Bible and leading everyone in prayer. The conference (Summit VIII) is a first step at ending the crisis of 163 million orphans worldwide, he said.
> 
> “This is the beginning of the end. It’s the end of orphans in the world,” Warren said.
> 
> While addressing the crisis in the U.S., he said, “If just one church in every four churches got one family to adopt there would be no more orphans in America. It’s not because we lack the resources, or lack the knowledge, or lack the skills… you are the skilled people who have been doing this… what we lack is the willingness for a group of people to say enough is enough, no more orphans.”

First of all, as [Kathryn Joyce points out](http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/gender/1488/the_evangelical_adoption_crusade/?page=entire), figures like the one Warren cites are almost certainly inflated, designed to create a sense of “crisis” that only massive intervention can resolve. That in turn, is meant to create demand for adoption which will then put pressure on governments and adoption agencies to relax regulations and allow for easier adoptions.

And if the number *isn’t* inflated, it’s utterly wishful thinking to presume that good Christian families can do away with orphandom. As I said last year when Summit VII came around,

> Children come with baggage: there’s traumatic history, medical issues, psychiatric problems, cultural differences, and so on. As if all that weren’t bad enough, as it happens most of the world’s “orphans” aren’t really orphans at all. Rather, they’re children whose families can no longer provide for their needs. That can become quite a problem when you’re adopting from overseas. Or, as in our case, what it means is that the kids really have two families. As messy and as difficult as it is sometimes, we have come to accept that their biological mother and grandmother will always be a part of their lives, and therefore always a part of our lives.

That’s still the case. And if all that isn’t enough, let’s not forget [the adoption movement’s unsavory side](http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/gender/1037/shotgun_adoption/?page=entire):

> Bethany guided Jordan through the Medicaid application process and in April moved her in with home-schooling parents outside Myrtle Beach. There, according to Jordan, the family referred to her as one of the agency’s “birth mothers”–a term adoption agencies use for relinquishing mothers that many adoption reform advocates reject–although she hadn’t yet agreed to adoption. “I felt like a walking uterus for the agency,” says Jordan.
> 
> Jordan was isolated in the shepherding family’s house; her only social contact was with the agency, which called her a “saint” for continuing her pregnancy but asked her to consider “what’s best for the baby.” “They come on really prolife: look at the baby, look at its heartbeat, don’t kill it. Then, once you say you won’t kill it, they ask, What can you give it? You have nothing to offer, but here’s a family that goes on a cruise every year.”
> 
> Jordan was given scrapbooks full of letters and photos from hopeful adoptive parents hoping to stand out among the estimated 150 couples for every available baby. Today the “birthmother letters” are on Bethany’s website: 500 couples who pay $14,500 to $25,500 for a domestic infant adoption, vying for mothers’ attention with profuse praise of their “selflessness” and descriptions of the lifestyle they can offer.
> 
> Jordan selected a couple, and when she went into labor, they attended the birth, along with her counselor and shepherding mother. The next day, the counselor said that fully open adoptions weren’t legal in South Carolina, so Jordan wouldn’t receive identifying information on the adoptive parents. Jordan cried all day and didn’t think she could relinquish the baby. She called her shepherding parents and asked if she could bring the baby home. They refused, chastising Jordan sharply. The counselor told the couple Jordan was having second thoughts and brought them, sobbing, into her recovery room. The counselor warned Jordan that if she persisted, she’d end up homeless and lose the baby anyway.
> 
> “My options were to leave the hospital walking, with no money,” says Jordan. “Or here’s a couple with Pottery Barn furniture. You sacrifice yourself, not knowing it will leave an impact on you and your child for life.”
> 
> The next morning, Jordan was rushed through signing relinquishment papers by a busy, on-duty nurse serving as notary public. As soon as she’d signed, the couple left with the baby, and Jordan was taken home without being discharged. The shepherding family was celebrating and asked why Jordan wouldn’t stop crying. Five days later, she used her last $50 to buy a Greyhound ticket to Greenville, where she struggled for weeks to reach a Bethany post-adoption counselor as her milk came in and she rapidly lost more than fifty pounds in her grief.
> 
> When Jordan called Bethany’s statewide headquarters one night, her shepherding mother answered, responding coldly to Jordan’s lament. “You’re the one who spread your legs and got pregnant out of wedlock,” she told Jordan. “You have no right to grieve for this baby.”

Bethany’s not a bit player, either. They operate all over the US, often contracted by the states to facilitate adoptions—they were the finalizing agency for our adoption. They’re not alone in this behavior, either. They’re not even the worst. Makes me wonder if being a fad wouldn’t be the worst thing for orphan care to be.

By the way, [Kathryn Joyce has a book on adoption](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-child-catchers-kathryn-joyce/1108942775) coming out next year. “Looking forward to it” is probably not the right expression, but yes, I’m sure it’ll be good.
