[Jonathan Rosenblum](http://www.prwatch.org/news/2012/08/11707/vp-role-paul-ryan-has-his-former-parish-priest-worried) has a long, rich interview with Paul Ryan’s former parish priest at the PR Watch site. The piece builds seamlessly from a color story to a wider-ranging consideration of whether Ryan’s budget ideas can be squared with Catholic social teaching, as the man himself claims. It’s good journalism, and well worth the read.

I have long been dubious about attacks (or criticism) on politicians on these grounds because it’s always seemed like rather weak tea. Yes, when someone like Ryan makes the rather dubious claim that heartless penny-pinching is consistent with the very specific claims of the Catholic church on what it means to have concern for the poor, he deserves to be held accountable for his position. It’s Randian crap from start to finish. That’s worth saying. But very few Catholics know or care much about the details of the social teaching, and the number of voters who will change their minds about which ticket to choose on November 6th by cries of “Rand, not Christ!” can be estimated safely by connecting one’s thumb and index finger with just the slightest curve.

This is not a contest of competing philosophies. It’s tribalism, pure and simple. The kind of people who will vote for Paul Ryan will do so whether or not he loves *Atlas Shrugged*. If you want to peel Catholic votes away from Romney-Ryan, find a way to kneecap the frothing partisans at the Conference of Catholic Bishops. That’s the most efficient strategy.

The “Paul Ryan’s a Randian, not a Christian,” like its conservative counterpart, “Obama’s a radical black liberationist, not a Christian” has always seemed to aim too low for my tastes. Who really gives a shit if you follow this theology or that one? It’s the religious equivalent of [process argument](http://prospect.org/article/whats-wrong-politics-driven-policy)

If you’re going to make a religious argument, make one that’s based on an actual faith claim. Here’s a couple, both derived from the work of Walter Brueggemann:

1. God provides for the future. When things stay the same in religion or politics, it favors the rich. It also limits God’s freedom to do what he wants, when he wants. God’s not interested in that.

2. God hears the cries of the poor, including the working poor. Politicians, not so much, though there are better and worse leaders on that score, and God works more or less for or against them on that score.

Most of our political talk is severely constrained, by the deficit boogeyman and by supposed limits of the system that turn out on closer inspection to be gentlemen’s pacts to do not much of anything for anyone outside the very limited community of the elites. Against this, the wild trickster God Yahweh declares that the future is undetermined, leaving open the possibility of real change that results in real responsiveness of the political system to those who need it the most. What on earth would be so wrong with a candidate saying, “I believe in God. I believe in the future. I believe that by the grace of God, things can be meaningfully different from the way they are now, and I believe that the will of God is that the life of the humble people be better than it is today”? *That’s* an argument worth having.
