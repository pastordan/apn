I’ve been working on my congregation to organize ourselves around being a place for families to help their children learn and grow in the faith. I keep coming back to the idea of being a school for faith, a school for hope, and a school for love. That wouldn’t work so well for some folks in one [Jacksonville church](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/darrell-gilyard-can-preach-at-church-children-barred-from-sermons_n_1291639.html):

> A convicted sex offender can keep on preaching, but children are barred from attending his sermons.

> The Florida Times Union reports that lawyers for Darrell Gilyard withdrew a motion to allow minors at sermons conducted by the former Jacksonville, Fla., megachurch pastor.

> Though children are not allowed, attendance at the Christ Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church has spiked since Gilyard began preaching in January, less than two months after he was released from prison, according to the Times Union.

Follow the link for details. But can I just say that above and beyond the wrongness of calling a sex offender as your pastor, calling a pastor on the basis of “he was down on the ground, and the church was down on the ground” is a really, really, really colossally *bad* idea.
