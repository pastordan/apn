A colleague once accused me of being “kyriarchical,” of using too much “church language” in my worship services. I had to wonder if she was listening to herself. What else would you use in a church service but the language of the church? It’s a bit like being accused of being Euro-Centric while teaching Hungarian. Why yes, I suppose I am.

She did have something of a point. The church, like any other social sub-group, has a tendency to develop quite a bit of jargon. It can be a problem. Visitors to the church who wouldn’t know a narthex from pneumatology might find church-speak a barrier to the community. In some parts of the United Church of Christ, that’s cause to remove the offending language immediately.

With a blowtorch, if necessary.

What people seldom realize is that the distinctive way Christians talk about things was consciously developed, or at least has been consciously preserved. Very early on, the church distinguished itself from the pagan mystery cults by speaking in plain, everyday language about itself, its practices, and who it worshiped. Over time, that language became more specialized, as it tends to do, but the Latin vocabulary provided a level playing field. A narthex is a narthex, whether you’re in Rome or Copenhagen. As Latin receded from common usage, it left the church terms marooned in English like boulders dropped from a retreating glacier. And as churchgoing stopped being a social expectation, people began to forget what all the verbiage meant.

The original idea, as I say, was to invite people into participation in the church, over and against more closed groups—like today’s Masons or other “secret societies.” The irony is that the church often winds up being exclusive in its language, the very opposite of what was intended for. And it’s always *that guy’s* fault—my language is clear as the eye of Balaam, son of Beor. Or something like that. Anyway, I have unchurched people to oppress.
