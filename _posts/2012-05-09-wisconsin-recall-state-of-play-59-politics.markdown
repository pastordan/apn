Generally speaking, I’m trying to get away from the pundit thing, but I offer up these thoughts for the family and friends who will sooner or later ask me what I think about the Cheese State’s recall election.

You may have heard the concern trolls pointing out that Scott Walker got almost as many votes for him as all the Democratic candidates received, combined. That’s true: Walker got 626,538 votes, while the Democratic pool collected 670,278. (Arthur Kohl-Riggs, Walker’s nominal opponent in the GOP primary, had nearly 20,000 more.)

People want to make this out to be evidence of an enthusiasm gap among Democrats, or of division in the Democratic base, and it just ain’t so. Yes, it’s surprising how many people came out for Walker, but overall, [turnout was amazing: 30%](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/turnout-for-recall-primary-breaks-percent/article_0f214d70-99db-11e1-bf15-0019bb2963f4.html) in the second election of 2012. Some people may have gone to the polls *five times* since 2012. To keep 30% of them turning out really shows you just how plugged in the Wisconsin electorate is this year.

To put things slightly differently, if you assume that everyone who voted in the Democratic primary signed the recall petition against Walker, the Dems just turned out ⅔’s of all signers—that is to say, their base—in a *primary*. This is big trouble for moose and squirrel, as they say. And contrary to what anyone might have told you, the Democratic base is not divided. Not deeply, anyway. I have yet to hear a Dem say they won’t vote for Barrett now that their favorite candidate is out of the race. In fact, Barrett won convincingly around the state, even in Falk’s home base of Dane County. Dems want one thing, and one thing only: somebody who can beat Walker. We’ll worry about the rest later.

What the primary numbers do show is how close this race is going to be. The total votes against Walker (assuming Kohl-Riggs supports will put down the bongs and vote for Barrett in June) come to 690,000 and change. That’s a 4% margin of victory, and I think it’s going to be tighter than that.

That being said, I just don’t see how the fundamentals of the race work in Walker’s favor. He’s poured millions of dollars into advertising, and all it’s done is keep his head slightly underwater against an opponent-to-be-named-later. Barrett’s just demonstrated that he’s got his base behind him, and he can draw votes around the state. The GOP’s voter suppression tactics have been tossed, there’s a John Doe investigation still hanging over Walker’s head, the unions and the Obama campaign will certainly lend their ground game to the Barrett campaign, and they’ll have a million-plus voter contact list to work with as they do it. And all of that is *before the election even starts*. Incumbents don’t typically increase in popularity during a campaign, all of which suggests that the only place Walker’s re-elect numbers have to go is down.

Could he still win? He certainly could. His job will be to turn out the Milwaukee suburbs and the Fox Valley while trying to hold down the vote in Dane, Milwaukee, and a few other places. He’s apparently going to try to do that by trying to link Barrett to former governor Jim Doyle and the “bad old days.” I’m dubious about how well that will work, but we’ll see.

Barrett’s job, meanwhile, will be to turn out as many voters as he can. To do that, he’s got to show more fire in the belly than he did in 2010. So far so good on that score: he came out with a stinging populist message in last night’s victory speech. I don’t think he’ll go full negative against Walker. Instead, I think he’ll try what he did last night, which is simply to point to the truth of Walker’s situation, and let the facts speak for themselves.

Why *does* our governor have to have a criminal defense fund?

Hopefully, he won’t for very much longer, but it’s going to be a nail-biter the whole way. We’ll keep you posted.
