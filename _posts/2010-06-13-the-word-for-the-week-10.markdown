[Exodus 2:1-22](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=145609287)

Today kicks off our summer sermon series on the book of Exodus, in approximately one gajillion parts. Just kidding: we’ll walk through Exodus in ten sermons between now and the end of August, with a few breaks here and there. We won’t be able to investigate the entire book—it’s just too big—but we’ll hit enough representative passages to give you a sense of the whole.

I wanted to do this series for a couple of reasons. First, because you asked for it. When we talked about sermons in our worship meeting this spring, people expressed an interest in learning more about scripture. Second, the confirmands and I have been walking through Genesis this past year, and it flows naturally to continue with Exodus. This way they won’t have to come to a separate class over the summer. Third, as it happens, I had been thinking about the Exodus story earlier this year. We Christians don’t often deal with it directly and as a whole. That’s a shame. Exodus, as I hope to show you, is the foundation of much of what we hear in the New Testament, and it still has something to say to us today.

So each week, I’ll tell you about a passage and try to connect it to the book of Exodus as a whole, as well as to the Christian faith. Ready?

Before we dig into today’s lesson, I want to say something about a particular word that you’re going to hear a lot: “redemption.” To redeem something means to buy it back. When used in reference to a person, it means to buy their freedom out of slavery. In Exodus, that is not a metaphor. God literally frees the Israelites from slavery. So when you hear me talk about God the redeemer, don’t think of God forgiving sins. Think of Abraham Lincoln emancipating the slaves. That’s a lot closer to what it means here.

In that regard, it is helpful to remember the backdrop of political oppression and genocide that opens the Exodus story. The Israelites are producing more children than are the Egyptians. That creates an economic threat and ultimately may displace the Egyptians in their own nation. Pharaoh’s answer to the problem is simple and brutal: kill all the Israelites’ sons.

Yet, miraculously, Moses survives and even flourishes right under Pharaoh’s nose. The stories we hear today introduce us to the character of Moses. Through him, they introduce us to the themes of the Exodus story. Moses’ experiences will later become the experiences of Israel. Moses’ actions also anticipate or foreshadow the actions of God: what he does, God will later do. Last, the situations Moses finds himself in will become situations that later leaders of Israel have to face. For example, Moses acts as judge between quarreling Israelites in today’s lesson, a job that he will have to take on full-time later in Exodus, and that remains the duty of Israelite leaders like Solomon and David.

That’s where things stand when Moses comes along. But his birth produces a situation shot through with irony. Moses is given life by the Nile, the river that represents Egyptian fertility. Pharaoh orders the Israelite sons killed, but the daughters survive and thwart his aims. For example, Moses’ mother saves him, and she winds up getting paid—with Pharaoh’s money, mind you!—to  nurse him. There is more irony in that: it is Pharaoh’s own daughter who publicly undermines his policy. She—a princess of the realm—takes advice from a slave, and she names Moses for exactly what he later will do for the Israelites. As she drew him out of the waters of the Nile, so he will draw them out of Egypt.

You might say she’s doing “God’s work” here, and in fact, what Pharaoh’s daughter does looks a lot like what God does in this story. She “comes down,” she “hears,” “sees,” takes pity, draws Moses out of the waters, provides for his daily needs. She also teaches him how to be a leader. In other words, she gives him the skills he needs to lead his people out from Pharaoh’s slavery.

That sets up even more irony. Moses, the liberator of his people, is rejected by them at first. The two quarreling Hebrews want nothing to do with him.  They refuse Moses’ call to justice and solidarity, values that he learns from the Egyptians, but values that will be needed if the people of Israel are to have a future different than the past they have experienced.

As Walter Brueggemann says, all of this reflects the divine irony: God uses the weak, the low or the despised to shame the strong. God works through persons without obvious power—at some risk—to give hope where there seems to be no hope. By that, I mean that God takes a chance on people to do the right thing. Moses’ mother could have simply killed him. Pharaoh’s daughter could have refused to pick him up. Or she could have gone for a walk in another direction.  Zipporah and her sisters could have forgotten to mention the “Egyptian” man they met at the well.

If you feel like that’s an awful lot of women, you’re right. Women are front and center in these stories. In fact, they are more prominent than God himself, who remains curiously in the background. The women work to save Moses, just as he—and God—will save Israel. They do so at no small risk to themselves. Moses’ mother and sister could have been killed for disobeying Pharaoh’s orders, and his own daughter is by no means safe. As one interpreter of this story says, “The courage of women is the beginning of liberation.” That’s worth noting in itself.

Another theme that we can touch on only briefly is the connection made here between God the creator and God the redeemer. They are one and the same in this story. They will remain so for the rest of Exodus.

You can see this connection in that wordplay between “ark” and “basket.” The same God that saved Noah and his family and established the rainbow covenant will save Moses and his “family,” the Israelite nation, and establish a new covenant with them in the 10 Commandments. When Pharaoh’s daughter sees Moses, she “sees that he was good,” the same phrase God uses in the creation in Genesis 1. Likewise, there is the symbol of life-giving water that appears here in the Nile and the well in the desert. Water will come back again in the Red Sea and in the waters at Meribah, where the Israelites complain and God brings water from a rock.

More generally, it is the same creator God who brought the Israelites down to Egypt to escape famine at the end of Genesis who will lead them back out to escape Pharaoh’s slavery in Exodus. “Redemption serves God’s goals in and for the creation,” says Brueggemann, “and creation sparks civil disobedience” as the Israelites refuse to cooperate with Pharaoh’s repression. God made the world to be free, and that freedom is naturally at odds with oppression and slavery.

All of this is great, but why should you care? Why should this almost 3,000 year old story still hold our attention?

First of all, as I mentioned earlier, Exodus is the foundation for much of what we read in the New Testament. To take the most obvious example, Jesus is the new Moses. Just as Pharaoh tried to kill the Israelites’ sons, Herod tries to kill the sons of Bethlehem. Just as Moses left his home country for a time only to return to free his people, Jesus leaves Israel for Egypt, to return sometime later. And just as the Israelites grumble and resist Moses’ teaching, so the Jews resist Jesus’ teaching. That’s the argument Stephen makes in the sermon he preaches just before he is stoned to death at the beginning of the book of Acts. There’s more, which we will get to later on.

But what I want you to understand right now is that understanding the Exodus story helps you to understand the gospel story. As Moses led his people out of slavery in Egypt, so Jesus came to lead them out of slavery in their own nation. You can understand that as leading them out of social and economic oppression, or as bringing them out of bondage to sin. Both themes are present in the gospel stories.

Either way, the point remains the same. God created the world to be free, and he is constantly at work to restore the freedom that his children lose over time. He does so by providing us with prophetic leaders like Moses and Jesus to help us imagine new paths forward. But he also does so by working quietly behind the scenes to give power to the powerless, voice to the voiceless, hope to the hopeless, and fullness of life to as many people as possible.

In that respect, it is not beside the point that God works through women in these stories, nor that he continues to do so today. “What the women do for Moses, God will do for all Israel.” That’s as true today for the people of God as it was for the Israelites. God works in surprising, often unseen ways, using unexpected and often powerless people to upend the powers that be in our world. Value your mothers and sisters and daughters, then. You never know when they might be doing the work of God.

Last but not least, like Israel, our new future depends on being in solidarity with one another. We have come a long way in this community in letting go petty conflicts and gossip and yes grumpiness, but there is always more distance to travel, always more to learn about being God’s people together. My prayer for this congregation is that God lead us into his future as one people, united in love and justice and hope for the promised land that God will surely give to us. Amen.
