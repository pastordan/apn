It’s nice to see your kids through the eyes of other parents sometimes. I heard from the mother of Bill’s classmate that she went to have lunch with her daughter the other day. To her surprise, Bill plunked down at the table with them.

“Good to see you, Bill, but don’t you usually eat with some of the other kids?” she asked.

“I’m trying to make better decisions for myself,” he responded. “I’ve been getting in too much trouble lately.”

How can you not be proud of that?

As for me: for many years now, I’ve done almost all my writing on Apple’s Pages program. For the most part, it’s a simple, very straightforward word processor. No fuss, no muss. But one thing it’s been missing is an auto backup feature.* The program crashes, anything you haven’t saved is toast.

There’s a simple workaround to the problem, but it has an unfortunate side-effect: it creates document after document “Backup of…”

So today, (with some help from the Google), I wrote a little program that sweeps up all those extra files and dumps them in a special folder where I don’t have to look at them. I even set it up to run once a day.

If you understand the world of programming, I might as well have written the thing in crayon. Given a little help, Bill could have written it. Still. It’s not something I’m used to doing, and therefore, I pat myself on the back.

No, I do not care if you don’t think I should be proud of myself.
