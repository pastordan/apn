I think this is fairly straightforward: the “Prayers of the People” for this coming Sunday, based on [Luke 24:36-48](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=201864257), the gospel lesson for the day. I couldn’t find a litany that matched the themes of the service, so I decided to challenge myself and write this.

I’m not very satisfied with it, even though it turned out better than expected, and even though it’s something of a victory just to be able to make myself write it. For whatever reason, I find it tremendously difficult to put something like this together. It has something to do with creeping perfectionism, I suppose. Anyway, the only way to do it well is to start doing it, and here we are. As always, feedback is welcome.

Gathered by Christ to be the people of God and witnesses to his resurrection, let us pray.

<div style="text-align: center;">*Silent Prayer*</div>Lord Jesus, you stand among us and greet us with peace. May your spirit and your body bring peace upon your church: around the world and here at Salem, the place of peace. Heal our wounds and make us present to one another. Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

You came to your disciples not as a ghost but as a man of flesh and blood. You stand with the broken bodies of the world. By your love and mercy, make them whole again. We pray especially for… Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

You challenged the disciples’ fear and doubts, asking them to touch and see you. Accept our too-timid faith, but draw it to deeper waters. Reassure our doubts. Push us to greater trust and confidence that you are with us. Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

Your friends greeted you with joy so strong they could scarcely believe their eyes. Show yourself to us and fill us with joy to meet you in one another. Build in us belief that your presence makes a difference in the world. Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

You tell us that the words of Scripture must be fulfilled. Open our eyes, our hearts, that we might understand God’s word. Form us as complete Christians. We pray for our children, who are just learning the faith, and for ourselves, that we might never become lazy or self-satisfied in the pilgrim way. Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

Your fulfillment was to suffer and rise from the dead. Granted power by your death and resurrection, enable us to stand with all who suffer and die. We pray especially for… Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

You sent your disciples to proclaim to all the nations repentance and forgiveness of sins. Keep us mindful of the things that shame us and for which we have found forgiveness in your sight. May we joyfully welcome all sinners to our church as brothers and sisters in Christ. Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

Your instructions were to begin in Jerusalem. Let your good news start here in Salem, with humble and open hearts joined together to be your people in the world. Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

You send us forth as witnesses of your death and resurrection and your continuing presence among us. Keep us mindful of the great cloud of witnesses who have gone before us in the faith: the saints and martyrs of the church, the dead of our own family. Risen Lord Jesus, **hear our prayer.**

Rejoicing in the Jesus’ presence here among us, let us join hands and pray in the words Christ our Savior has taught us:

*Our Father, who art in Heaven,  
hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come,  
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.  
Give us this day our daily bread,  
and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,  
for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,  
forever and ever. Amen.*
