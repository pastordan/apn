So I’ve had a pretty good day, if I do say so myself. Some of you will have seen this already via Twitter or Facebook, but I know there are a fair number of you who won’t, and those include some of the people who would be most proud, so.

<div><span></span></div><div><span>I’ve been trying to do some writing lately, partly to have something to do, and partly to have something to do that *makes* money, rather than *costs* it. It’s finally starting to pay off.</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Over the weekend, I caught a Scott Simon interview with an—ahem—very orthodox Catholic about what causes churches to thrive or decline. I reacted to the piece at [Religion Dispatches](http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/atheologies/6933/are_conservative_churches_really_winning_by_being_more_orthodox), and they ran it this afternoon.</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>No sooner had it gone up than I got word that a longer-term project had come to fruition: *The Christian Century* is running [a reported piece](http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-03/gun-control-sight) that I wrote on faith-based gun control activism. This is my first article for *The Christian Century*, and my first publication in a traditional magazine (with Wendell Berry, no less!), so you can imagine, this is a big deal.</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Hopefully, there’s more of this to come. I have a couple of stories in the pipeline, a couple more I’m working on, and a few that I need to start developing. With any luck, you’ll be seeing more of my byline before too long.</span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>And it did snow today, about 3″. We’ve had enough winter, thank you. It’s time for spring. Now, please.</span></div>
