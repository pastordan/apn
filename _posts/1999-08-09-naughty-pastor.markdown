Before introducing some new and bizarre topic to A Pastor’s Notebook, it might be helpful to pause for a moment and take stock of how the columns have been going up to this point. Over the eight weeks or so that APN has been running, two sets of feedback worth responding to have developed—one serious, one less so.

 Let’s take the serious set first. A couple of readers, albeit a very astute couple, were uncomfortable with my treatment of the dismissal of Faith church’s secretary and the consistory meeting that led up to her firing. They pointed out, rightly I think, that that was material better left out of a public forum. I agree, and here’s why. There are a couple of ethical lines that must be observed in writing: one is between the desire to remain frank and honest about the subject at hand, and, on the other hand, inappropriately sharing material that has been given to you in confidence. What can I say? I was on the wrong side of that line at least once. I was angry, frustrated, tired, and wanted to be honest about the source of those feelings; I didn’t take into consideration how that might reflect on people with whom I am trying to build mutual trust, or that it just wasn’t appropriate in the first place to let fly in the Notebook.

 The other line that has be observed, at least in writing humor, is the one between using humor as a way of letting go, and using it as a weapon. It’s perfectly healthy to use humor, even on occasion some biting sarcasm, to release a little tension, work off a little stress. It’s also healthy to work out your aggression on a punching bag—but when you start to use people instead of punching bags, there’s a problem. I want to say for the record that as irritated and unhappy as I can be with the members of my consistory, I have always believed them to act in good faith, and for the betterment (as they understand it) of the church. I think my frustration comes less from their persons than it does with the continual need to realign the energy of our system—we’re stuck in a very particular and very frustrating way of behaving at the moment—breaking out of that mode is difficult for everyone.   
 I let the frustration and the anger get the best of me in that column, and I’m willing to take responsibility for it. No more columns on consistory meetings, that’s for sure. It also seems like it would be a good idea to slow down my production schedule for the Notebook; if I had left enough time for a second look at the column in question, I probably would have taken out the offending material. As it was, I was a bit leery, but decided to go with it so I could get the column out that afternoon.

 So. Beginning with next week’s installment, A Pastor’s Notebook will come out either late Thursday afternoon or on Friday morning. That will allow me to write a draft on Monday afternoon and (hopefully) to revise it later in the week. I’m also trying to figure out a way to get some peer editing before I send out my columns. It’s said every worthwhile writer has a good editor standing behind them, and now I see why. I’ll let you know more when I’ve got it figured out.

 The other feedback that I hear a lot is that my columns are too esoteric. I’m not sure what people mean by this. Doesn’t everyone collect baseball conspiracy theories? Doesn’t everyone read *The New Republic* and *The American Spectator?*<sup>1</sup> I don’t understand. And does no one but me find the topic of ceramic lawn ducks fascinating? How can this be? I’m afraid I’m at a loss for words (for once).

 One reader from Minnesota wrote in recently wondering when I would move on from the “arcane and esoteric topics into something more concrete, say, for example, math and science.” Naturally enough, this reader is an electrical engineer who absorbs math and science with his morning coffee. He also has more beautiful daughters than any father has a right to, but we won’t hold any of that against him. No, what we will hold against him is that he went to Lafollette Memorial High in our hometown of Madison, Wisconsin, and Lafollette had very good shop and industrial education programs. I, by contrast, went to Madison West High, which, shall we say, was a bit more cerebral? Something like 90% of our graduates went on to college, and probably 85% of them were involved in some manner with theatrical productions. Nearly all of them could quote a mean Sartre if cornered in a dark alley. In this hotbed of pretense and rampant nerdism, it’s little wonder that I developed a taste for the more *unusual* of topics.

One of the group of intellectual thugs who graduated from West with me was probably closer to the mark when he quipped that last week’s baseball-and-self-analysis theme didn’t do much for him until he began to read the column through the lens of a certain unmentionable, and compulsive, behavior usually associated with adolescent boys. (Speaking of adolescent boys, our gang really hasn’t changed much from high school.) It’s quite difficult to disprove such a hermeneutical lens, at least not without utterly humiliating oneself, so I muttered something about “artistic sublimation” and let it go at that. But I should take the opportunity to say that there are times when you just have to take this column at face value; I really was just writing about baseball.

 The other thing that needs to be said on the subject of subjects, arcane or otherwise, is that I am in fact a profound idiot. Oh yes, I know I have a big vocabulary and like to mention books that no one else has ever heard of, but it’s all a dodge. As an intellectual, I am a respectable fraud, and as a writer, I’m slightly less of a cretin than Norman Mailer and slightly more of a villain than whoever it is that concocted Chicken Soup for the Soul. I like to write about things I don’t understand, which turns out to be most of ‘em. I like to write about those things because doing so makes me feel like I’m learning something, which is rarely true, and because the subjects make me giggle like a simpleton, which is more often the case. Easily amused and cortically challenged; it’s a recipe for disaster. Ah, but what a glorious disaster it is—and besides, I got you to read this far, didn’t I? Just laugh along with me, then. It’s more fun that way, and nobody has to worry about Dan getting himself into serious trouble…

<sup>1</sup>Here’s an experiment sure to make my sister the librarian mad:  go down to your local public library.  Ask them if they carry either one of these magazines.  If they do, ask them why, as nobody ever reads the damn things.  Be sure to tell me how the librarian reacts.
