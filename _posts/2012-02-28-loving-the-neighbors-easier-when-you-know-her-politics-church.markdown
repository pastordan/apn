Says the [Daily Yonder](http://www.dailyyonder.com/small-town-diversity/2012/02/24/3782):

> A new study finds that in smaller-scale social environments, people are more likely to befriend those who are different from themselves. How many morticians and can-collectors do you know?

In my line of business, I know quite a few morticians. Can-collectors, admittedly, not so much. In any event:

> [The scholars write](http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/07/05/1368430211410751), “When opportunity abounds, people are free to pursue more narrow selection criteria [in forming friendships], but when fewer choices are available, they must find satisfaction using broader criteria.”

As they say at the Daily Yonder, this phenomenon is part of what makes small towns and rural areas so wonderful. In those environments, you takes your friends where you can get them. And again as they point out, in small towns and rural landscapes, it’s not uncommon for people to cobble together a living doing two, sometimes three jobs, or for them to be both the pastor and the kids’ softball coach (for example). So you have the opportunity to meet people in several different contexts, which increases the opportunities for bonding.

I might add that the same principle applies to small churches just as well. In larger congregations, you have the luxury of picking and choosing your friends. In fact, in some churches you almost have to. My father-in-law attends a Catholic church that’s large even by their standards. He really can’t do more than say hi to a few familiar faces after church before they all have to leave to make room for the next service. He knows a fair number of people at the church, but it’s anybody’s guess which service they’ll attend and if he’ll be able to catch them.

Obviously, small churches are different. When there’s 15 or 25 or 35 of you in worship on a Sunday morning, you get to know everyone, whether you like it or not, and the scale brings you into contact with folks you might not meet otherwise. In our congregation, for example, we have a butcher, a farmer, an electrician, a retired excavator, contractors, a chef-in-training, teachers, a psychology professor, “someone who puts pictures of toilets on the internet” for a living, and a pinhead blogger and author. This is not even the most diverse church I’ve served.

There is some theory to suggest that [the human brain can only handle so many social connections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number) at a time. If scientists are correct about this, the number is around 150—as it happens, the upper limit on a “small” church.

That in turn raises a question about the quality of connections we make. Assuming we do have so few relationships to parcel out, is it better for them to be homogeneous, or do we want them to be more diverse? In my experience, most people will say they prefer the latter, but their actual social circle will look more like the former. That’s fine, it’s just human nature. We all have a tendency to overestimate the breadth of our friendships, I think.

Small communities and small churches force us to fight that tendency, at least to some extent. Our church and town are anything but diverse racially, but fairly heterogeneous when it comes to politics. To the extent that they make us deal with people with different opinions, they provide a valuable service to the broader community, making sure that the many viewpoints out there remain interpenetrable, a social good in a nation increasingly given to [self-selection in geography and voting](http://www.fairobserver.com/article/polarization-and-uncompetitive-districts-don%E2%80%99t-blame-redistricting-blame-movers). Just another reason small is beautiful when it comes to towns and churches.

**Edit 1**: My wife informs me I am idiot. She’s usually correct in such matters. She says that Catholics are very particular about which service they attend. If you’re a 9:00 person, you stay a 9:00 person. All I know is my father-in-law bounces around. Anyway, Mrs Pastor also reminds me that our “butcher” actually works in the frozen food section of his grocery store. My apologies for the errors.

**Edit 2**: In case you doubt why this stuff might be important, let’s talk about why [Rick Santorum doesn’t like public education](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/opinion/bruni-its-a-college-not-a-cloister.html):

> If you couple the selectiveness and stridency of Santorum’s lament about college with his and his wife’s decision to home-school all seven of their children, you have to wonder if his real beef with higher education is that it threatens the indoctrination that has sometimes occurred already around the kitchen table. It does what it’s supposed to do, encouraging young adults to survey a broader field of perspectives, exhorting them to tap into a deeper well of information, inviting them to draw their own conclusions, and allowing them to figure out for themselves what they believe and who they are.About 1.5 million American children were home-schooled in 2007, the latest year for which the Department of Education provides an estimate. When their parents were asked why, they most commonly cited moral and spiritual reasons. There’s a positive way to regard that: these moms and dads are making a greater personal investment in their kids. There’s a negative way as well: they’re not so much impressing as radically imposing their values on their offspring by cutting them off from alternative viewpoints.

> Is that really good parenting? The likelihood is already strong, when you rear kids, that you’ll turn out rough copies of yourself, whether you mean to or not. Home schooling is like firing up a Xerox machine to seal the deal.

Small is beautiful. Too small is just too small.
