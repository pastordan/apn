title: Feeling Other In The Public Square (Of Masons and Mormons) [Church]

Last night, I conducted a funeral service for a member of the congregation. Turnout at the funeral home was good in part because the dead man had been a Mason.

The local lodge came and did a [Masonic funeral service](http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masons/Misc/funeral-svc.html) before my portion of the evening began. If you’ve never seen one of these before, they’re quite elaborate, really little funerals unto themselves. There are prayers, scripture, a reading of the deceased’s obituary, and an interpretation of the meaning of death for Masons. At the end, the Lodge Master and Chaplain speak of the symbol of the lambskin apron, and the lodge members circle the room, dropping a sprig of acacia or evergreen at the casket. (In this case, before the urn bearing the ashes.)

It takes a while to get through the service. In fact, I think theirs was longer than mine. I waited patiently while they spoke about the Masonic symbols and theology, none of which I agree with. They say that death is only an illusion because the soul lives on with God. I think death is real and when the resurrection comes our bodies are going to be put back together. They say death is a part of God’s plan. I say shit happens and God deals with it. And so on.

I was having these theological debates in my head while waiting my turn when it occurred to me that this must be how non-believers feel when a Christian worship service breaks out on every side of them. The symbolism, narrative and logic of Christianity makes sense to me, but then I grew up with it and have studied it besides. It must feel like listening to a strange and not entirely benevolent foreign language to those who aren’t used to it. They, like me watching the Masons, must feel a bit angry and offended to have a whole symbolic world that they neither understand nor entirely agree shoved in their faces. Like me, they probably wonder what makes members of this odd community assume that everyone knows and accepts what they’re saying.

I don’t begrudge the Masons their rites, and I understand that they’re based in Christian belief. But they’re different enough from the language and practice of the church that I would not allow them in my sanctuary. I don’t allow military honors or fire companies, either. Realizing that makes me wonder if non-Christians feel the same way when I start nattering on: *Nice guy, he’s got a right, but I wouldn’t let him in my living room talking this craziness*.

It’s one thing to do a funeral in the church, of course, and another to do it in a funeral home. People come to church expecting God-talk. I think I will adjust the my services to spell out some of the implicit assumptions, though, and try to be mindful that when I’m at the funeral home, not everyone is on the same page as me. In addition to the Masons, we had Mormons in the congregation last night, and probably some non-believers or members of other faiths as well. It doesn’t take much effort to invite them into your understanding of the world, rather than assume it at them.

After the service, the Lodge Master came over to introduce himself. He had his son with him, the very stereotype of a nerdy little kid with big ears, glasses, and a bow tie.

“How old are you?” I asked.

“Eight,” he told me. He had to repeat himself over the noise of the room.

“My son is eight as well,” I said. “And in two minutes, it will be past his bedtime. I’ll bet it will be past yours as well.”

He agreed without a smile.

“When I was eight,” I told him, “My father used to drag me to all sorts of things like this. Now my son is eight and I drag him along with me. So on behalf of your father, thank you for being patient. I know he appreciates it.”

A quick, serious nod.

I gave a stage whisper. “Make him buy you some ice cream.”

He looked up at his dad with a big grin. Some things are universal.
