<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Brindle-Baby-1-300x225.jpg)](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Brindle-Baby-1.jpg)</div>Callie showed up for a little while this afternoon, but we haven’t seen her since. I half expect her to turn up with a ladder and an ax to break in the glass on the back door. That cat won’t be satisfied until she’s a member of the family. Pet rabbits beware.
