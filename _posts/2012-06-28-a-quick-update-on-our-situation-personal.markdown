I haven’t been in a mood to write much lately, for obvious reasons. But I know you all are simply dying to hear more about where things stand with my family.

…

Right. Never mind that bollocks, you’re going to hear it anyway.

Here’s the background: we’ve known for a while that giving has been declining at Salem. At the end of last year, in a *very* contentious congregational meeting, we agreed to keep my position at three-quarters time. There is a long and not necessarily interesting story about why that meeting was so contentious and some of the patterns of group behavior it reflected, but for right now let’s just say that the vote went one way and the money went another.

So at the start of June, it became clear that the church could no longer guarantee my salary past the end of September. On September 30th, they would have to make essentially a balloon payment on my health insurance and pension, which would wipe out their cushion. To make matters worse—and this is why we all agreed it wasn’t worth fighting past the rough spot—on an annualized basis, the giving wasn’t there for even a quarter-time position. We would have had to close a $14,000 gap to meet the budget, and in a congregation with less than 100 members, that wasn’t going to happen.

Time to say goodbye.

<BITTERNESS> Some people seem to think that when we leave, the money and the members will come flooding back in. These same people think that unicorns will fart rainbows in my absence. The reality is that the people who have left are gone for good, and the people who stayed and kept giving have just lost their primary reason to give. The reality is that they’re screwed. What they can afford is to have someone come in to do the Sunday service and maybe a little visiting, and that’s about it. It may take a while, but the community will eventually dwindle and die. </BITTERNESS>

Once it became clear I was going to have to leave, I came up with four options for what came next:

> 1. Get another church in the UCC  
> 2. Get another church in another denomination  
> 3. Become a college instructor and/or writer  
> 4. Do something else

Let’s run down those options, and then you’ll be up to speed.

**1.** It didn’t take very long to get my profile (essentially a pastoral resume) completed, and only a little longer to get all eight—count ’em, eight—references back. But I misunderstood the process for initiating the required background checks. Assuming the FBI doesn’t have anything in my file about illegally trafficking monitor lizards, those should be back by the end of the week, and I will be officially cleared to search. There is at least one congregation that seems like a pretty good possibility, but it will more than likely be at least a few weeks before we’re ready to talk.

**2.** I spoke with officials from two different Synods in the ELCA, and was grateful to do so. But their advice was that I’d have better luck trying to find a congregation through the UCC. Trying to be a UCC guy serving an ELCA congregation would be a minor miracle, and the process to fully convert to Lutheranism would take one to two years—with no guarantees of a church at the end of it. I’ll keep that one in my hip pocket. Likewise, I’ve heard the Methodists are hard up for pastors in Wisconsin, but there are some lines even I am reluctant to cross.

**3.** This is the area with the most success so far. I’m signed up to teach one section of “Christianity and Contemporary Culture” at Lakeland College this fall, and just agreed to lead a section of the first-year seminar at Marian University. There are other courses that might be available, but I want to be careful not to overcommit myself. The idea of becoming a college prof is appealing, and one where I could make substantial contributions. But until the damn hippies force us to buy health insurance from the gummit, somebody has to have a full-time position to provide it to the family. Unless Mrs Pastor gets an offer, this too will have to go on hold for the moment.

**4.** I am in the very initial phases of talking to a consulting company about doing some work with them, so that’s all the details I can offer at the moment. It’s enticing because it probably pays much better than anything in the church world, but it’s also a pretty sharp departure in terms of both career and lifestyle, and therefore scary. However, being a consultant beats “Do you want fries with that?” so yeah. I’d do that.

As you can tell, we’re not without options here. The whole situation seems a bit funny to me. I’ve been praying along the lines of, “I’ve stayed faithful to the call, Lord, so just send me to the right place and I’ll go,” only to be presented with *multiple* right places to go. It’s a good place to be in that if something doesn’t seem like a good fit, I can say no with some confidence that I’ll land somewhere else. In the meantime, we’re doing okay. We don’t have a mortgage, and we don’t have car payments. If all goes well, we can make it to the end of the year without tapping our savings, and our reserves will carry us for a while past that. Our major concern is the health insurance.

Expect us to announce our departure for a civilized nation with socialized health care imminently. I’ve heard Sweden is beautiful this time of year.
