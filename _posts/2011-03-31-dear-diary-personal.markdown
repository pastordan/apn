After dinner the other night, as the sky turned golden and the black shadows got longer, I went into town to get a few things at the Piggly Wiggly: peanuts, pita bread, jelly beans. It’s Easter season. I don’t go anywhere these days without picking up speckled jelly bird eggs. The teenagers working the register had no idea where to find pita bread. They didn’t even know what it was. Who doesn’t know what pita bread is? Finally, they asked the assistant manager who took us right to it. Then they sent me home with a fistful of paper: four long coupons, a receipt, and a statement of my Pig Points.

When I pulled into the driveway, Bill was standing in the yard holding a baseball and his mitt. He had been watching for me to pull around the corner to the parsonage. By the time I got out of the car, he was in the garage bringing my glove over to me and offering to take the groceries inside. Okay, I guess the kid wants to play catch. So we did for a little while, until he got a little too goofy and threw the ball over my head once too often. Then it was time to inspect the remains of last year’s garden. I pulled up a dead flower stalk, and a rabbit shot out from the brush and bounded away, past the house.

There were lots of ghost vegetables left—the white, hollow remains of last year’s jack o’ lanterns, carrots, one soggy-looking pepper. Some new carrots are growing, and I thought I saw a new onion sprouting as well, but that turned out to be just another ghost. The rhubarb is slowly unfolding, though. At the moment, it looks like a bit of wilted red cabbage. By the time Bill’s rubberball season begins and I can explain to him [the proper meaning of the word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_English_language_idioms_derived_from_baseball), I expect it will be up to our knees or perhaps even a little higher.
