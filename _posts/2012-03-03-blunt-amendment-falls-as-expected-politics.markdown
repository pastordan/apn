So Roy Blunt (R-MO) attached a rider to a transportation bill [rolling back the Obama administration’s birth control “accommodation”](http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20120302/SHE0101/203020400/Senate-kills-bill-reverse-Obama-s-controversial-birth-control-policy?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE&located=rss) with the Catholic bishops. He tried to, anyway. Harry Reid smelled an opportunity and forced a separate vote on the amendment, even after Republicans tried to undo the political damage they had wreaked on themselves.

The vote appears to have been close:

> By a 51-to-48 tally, Democrats successfully killed a bill sponsored by Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt called the “Respect for Rights of Conscience Act,” which would have allowed employers or insurers to decline to provide free contraceptive coverage and other health services that violate their religious or moral beliefs.

I wonder if Democratic leaders didn’t count heads and allow a few members of their caucus to vote “yes” to provide a little electoral coverage. It happens.

The article natters on about how both sides are using this to “rev up” their bases. I think that’s a stretch. So’s this:

> And while some in the GOP have grown squeamish about the focus on social issues, there’s little question that Obama’s contraception mandate has alienated some Catholics and revved up Christian conservatives.

It’s often difficult for journalists to break out of “he said, she said” formulas when reporting a story like this. It’s even more difficult for some Christians to how to respond, knowing that both sides of the controversy is likely represented in their church. I think there’s a relatively simple way to judge the situation, which is to apply Habermas’ dictum that “citizens owe to one another good reasons for their positions.” That Catholic churches don’t want to provide their conscience by providing birth control coverage to their employees is probably a good reason to excuse them from the requirement to do so. (Just to be clear, this is already the case.) But a large health-care corporation that works with and serves people of many different faiths and conscience? Well, that’s less clear. It is a far more difficult case to make that *I* should be bound by your conscience than that you should be allowed to live by it yourself, after all.
