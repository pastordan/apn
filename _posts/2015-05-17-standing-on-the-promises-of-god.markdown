*The following are excerpts of a funeral sermon I gave this afternoon. I’ve taken out the parts specific to the deceased, who was the brother of a church member.*

I have been thinking a lot about the promises of God lately. I said in a sermon this morning that ways of talking about our faith that don’t begin with God’s promises aren’t worth very much. I even think that’s true! It is the promises of God that call the world into being, that give time shape and purpose, and that lead us as individuals the world at large into our appointed ends. Because God promises, we live. Because God promises, we have hope.

We hear these promises all throughout today’s service. How did we begin this afternoon?

Hear the promises of God: I am the resurrection and the life; all who believe in me, though they die, yet shall they live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.

And we hear it again in the [gospel reading](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=298897152):

For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.

You might think, given what I have just cited, that the basic promise of God is life after death. If you asked the average person on the street what the Christian faith was all about, there’s a pretty good chance that that would be their answer. Being a Christian means that after you die, your soul goes to Heaven to live with Jesus and God, forever.

But as [Paul tells us](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=298897100), life after death isn’t actually God’s primary promise. Not exactly, anyway. The promise is that “neither death, nor life…nor anything else will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Nothing will keep us away from God’s love, not even death. Come what may after we depart from the world, God will still be there to love us and seek to make us whole again.

Young people sometimes ask me why, given that promise, Christians are still afraid to die. I tell them that it’s still frightening to walk that lonesome valley by yourself. The truth is that all we have is God’s promise, and no matter how much we think we ought to trust in it, or how much we actually do trust in it, we still have to swing ourselves out into the emptiness like a trapeze artist trusting that he will catch our hands this one last time. Of course we’re afraid.

But we also fear because we know that to lose our lives means just that. Our memories fade too quickly. Almost always, all our accomplishments in life are forgotten immediately. Even our names are lost within a generation or two. All that we are, all that we have, all that we have lived and died for, will disappear some day.

…

It’s not easy to say goodbye to a life like Jim’s, but we must. That’s why it’s so important to hold it up to the light one last time and say, “This person we cherished.” This person we cherished, and now we have to give him up, trusting him to the promises of God.

We know and we affirm that God’s word is strong and true, that his promises will be kept. Nothing, not even life or death can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus. God loves us so much that he gave his only Son, that we might not perish, but might have eternal life.

And yet, we have to pray: dear God, keep your promises. Take Jim into your arms, and be there for us when our turn comes to let go of life and reach out into the void waiting and hoping for your hands to latch on to ours. Amen.
