Just finished writing a very challenging sermon for Palm Sunday, in which I ask the church to acknowledge the ways in which we fail our young people by using up our time and energy on petty drama instead putting their faith formation at the top of our agenda. In our case, it’s stupid crap like the arrangement of the pews or money given away to mission years ago. Other churches have similar fights. I know more than one congregation that’s had battles royale over whether to update the carpet in the sanctuary. Everybody’s got a story.

What drives these stupid, distracting conflicts is first that they’re what many people can get hold of. Church for many many people is a religiously-themed social club. They are neither much aware of, nor much interested in, the bigger picture of the faith. For some people, the sanctuary carpeting really is the most important thing about church.

But there is also a certain amount of anxiety that funds this stuff. I don’t mean the interpersonal anxiety that comes along with living in community, or the chronic psychological anxiety that some people refine into a toxin that they then inject into the community. That stuff’s bad, but it’s not really the problem. The biggest problem is that to the extent some people *are* aware of the transcendent dimensions of faith, the mystery of life and death in Christ, it freaks them right out. Now, some people just need to put their big boy pants on and deal with it, but as writing the sermon reminded me, the gospel message really is quite challenging. It is ridiculous from any kind of rational perspective to think that a dead man could be raised from the grave after three days, and that somehow that effects a change in the cosmos. But to accept it is even worse in the sense that it invites you into his death with the promise of life to come. Worse still, this is a reality learned by living it, one tentative step at a time. There is no such as a fully Christian person, because the faith is a journey, not an achievement. That’s why the first Christians called it “The Way,” after all.

If you take the tenets of Christianity seriously (or if you have the misfortune of having a pastor who takes it seriously), you quickly come to the conclusion that it offers precious little in the way of security. We are saved from sin and death by the graciousness of God, and we are meant to live out that reality in word and deed. If you’re nervous about your ability to live up to that message, or if you’re just a nervous, negative person to begin with, *of course* your anxiety is going to skyrocket.

People deal with that anxiety by displacing it onto smaller, more manageable things. They worry about the placement of the pews or the color of the carpet or the job the pastor is doing because they can’t bear to worry about the bigger things: what does my life mean? What will happen to me when I die? Why do I feel so lonely in my existence? This works on the small scale, as I’ve been saying, but also on a bigger level. People fight about whether the church should be committed to social justice or to combatting abortion, homosexuality and pornography in part because they cannot bear to think about the bigger picture, which is what it means that we die and live in Christ. A truly non-anxious church would have no need to change anyone’s behavior. It would simply offer its witness, and go about its life, without regard to those who refuse to change.

That doesn’t mean that church should not aim at changing the world, or changing the hearts of its members. It simply means that Christians aren’t called to worry about other people’s failures. If we spent a lot less time on that and a lot more on doing what’s right and important, I think we’d be a lot better off in too many ways to count.
