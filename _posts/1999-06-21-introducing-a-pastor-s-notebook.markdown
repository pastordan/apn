Let’s play a game. I’ll pretend to be a young pastor with a writing jones that just won’t quit, a funnybone that’s aching to be tickled, and a desperate need to do something, anything, to distract himself from the anxieties of ministry. You pretend to be an interested, friendly group of readers who would welcome insightful, humorous writing from a deeply spiritual perspective. Then pretend that you’re willing to read what I send you anyway.

In return, I’ll offer what amounts to a weekly newspaper column without the newspaper. My goals for this “column” are simple: I hope to give you some good writing and the kind of perspective you won’t find in Time, Newsweek, or The Watchtower. A week might bring a brief story, an extended joke, or a reflection on whatever stray topic floats across my desk. No sermons or homilies, though. I write quite enough of those dreadful things, as do many of you. Also, I want to keep this brief: no more than a page or two at a time. I need to be able to get it done—and you need to be able to read it—fairly quickly. We’re all busy, and we’ve all got too much information coming at us, to allow for anything else.

Your part of the game, should you choose to play, is to sass me back as much as you feel is appropriate. Tell me I’m wrong, tell me I’m a fool, tell me a story to top the one I told you; it’s all welcome and appreciated. Writing, like ministry, is a performance art, and it thrives on the sense of a community to feed, support, and occasionally harass it. To that end, if you know someone who you think would appreciate this material, by all means pass it on. Forward it to them, or shoot me an e-mail with their address, and I’ll add them to my list.

So now that you know how to play the game, shall we begin? Three-card draw, aces high, jokers wild?

Perhaps I should say, ducks wild, because this week’s conversation piece involves, er, a conversation piece. To wit, one ceramic or porcelain duck, about 18” high, white with orange bill and feet, and as beady a gaze as wildfowl ever possessed. My feathered friend was in the ivy in front of my house when I came back from the store the other day, and I have to admit, he stopped me cold. I looked up one side of the street and down the other. I was sure, just sure, that some joker was lurking behind a tree, waiting to see my reaction. But no one was in sight, and all my neighbors and churchmice deny any knowledge of this avian lawn statuary.

He wasn’t there that morning, and I doubt I could have lived in my place for six months without noticing him, either. Again, I was sure that some kid had swiped him from a nearby grassy knoll, so I put my web-toed guest in a prominent place on the porch and waited, hoping someone would redeem him from his exile. But if there is a God of porcelain lawn ducks, He isn’t listening to the cries of His people. The duck stands on the Egypt of my porch yet, awaiting its moment of justice and liberation.

You might say, then, that I am stuck with a duck. Or you might not, suit yourself. Whether you do or not, however, I still have the bird. Which leads to an interesting series of questions: is it my responsibility to track the owners of this purloined yard ornament? Or should I just accept my fate and consent to being adopted by this ungainly replica? If so, what should I call it? Would it go immediately next to any statues of St. Francis I might acquire, or far, far away? Ought I to be concerned about the duck’s shady past? Should I get rid it as quickly as possible? Should I perhaps give you the bird? Just let me know…and stay tuned for next week’s thrilling adventures in *A Pastor’s Notebook*.
