*I covered for a vacationing colleague this past week, going to see a family whose father was reaching the end of his life. I knew he didn’t have very long, but I figured he’d linger for another day or two, and by the time the funeral was scheduled, my colleague would be back. Wrong. He died the day after his 90th birhday, an hour and a half after I visited and offered prayer for him. When I say “go in peace,” it’s not an order!*

*Anyway, the family was kind enough to ask me to preside at the funeral. They’re great folks, so it was an honor. Below is the “faith” part of the sermon.*

I mentioned a minute or two ago that D– was tolerant in his faith. But you should never make the mistake of thinking that his tolerance meant he himself had no strong faith. He did, even if he wasn’t necessarily showy about it. He attended church regularly. Meticulous as ever, he would dress himself up in a suit and tie whenever he went, sometimes taking one of the kids with him. He lived a good life, he was good to the people around him, and he followed God’s rules. At the end, he would sometimes exclaim, “O God, take this out of my body.”

That is a prayer that many of us could pray at the end of our lives. We could say “O God, take this out of my life” whenever we suffered. It would be a perfectly adequate prayer. Suffer we must sometimes, and eventually die. It was not easy for D– to lose control of his body, not easy for such a strong man to become weak, not easy for a do-it-yourself man to ask for help. He missed his wife, missed being self-sufficient and in control. Thankfully, the end of his life was quick: he lingered only a few days, and then was gone.

When we mourn the loss of a beloved father, grandfather, and friend like D– K–, part of what we mourn is the way in which his death punctures the illusion of our own mortality. Don suffered and died, and so will we, sooner or later.

There is no one on earth or in heaven who take that reality away from us. Not God the Father, not his son, Jesus Christ. In place of release from the reality of death, we receive [a promise](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=307360387): that

neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Death may take us from one another, temporarily, but it can never separate us from God. “In my Father’s house there are many dwelling-places,” [Jesus tells his disciples](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=307360457), “so that where I am, there you may be also.” We are invited to live with God, promised that there will always be room for us in God’s house and in God’s heart.

And for those of us who believe, we are promised that in and through Christ, we will find life. It is no longer we who live, but Christ, and our lives are hidden in his. Death only reveals this to us. It forces us to trust and hope and pray that God does love us, that Christ does care for us, that he will provide and continue our lives even though our eyes tell us that death has taken over.

“I am the way, the truth, and the life,” Jesus says. He is the way forward after death, the truth of God’s love for Bapa Don all the days of his life on earth and beyond, and the life that will not quit us, even after our deaths. That promise need not be exclusive to show us a reality that is stronger than death: God loves us and wants to be with us, now and always. We must say goodbye to D– K– today, wishing him peace and rest and light eternal. We are strong enough to do so only knowing that God keeps his word, for Don and for all of us. Amen.
