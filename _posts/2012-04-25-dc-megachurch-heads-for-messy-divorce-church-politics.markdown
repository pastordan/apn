How tired I get of [ledes like this](http://www.christianpost.com/news/dc-area-megachurch-experiencing-possible-schism-73803/):

> A multimillion dollar ministry in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area is getting closer to a schism as its congregation worshipped in two different locations this past Sunday.

This is from the same kinds of folks who will tell you that churches who welcome gays and lesbians are contrary to the spirit of True Christianity.

I’ll bet you could almost fill in the details for yourself:

> Pastor Joel R. Peebles, son of the two founders, led a service at the ballroom of the Metro Points Hotel in New Carrollton after being ousted from Jericho by the Board of Trustees of Jericho Baptist Church Ministries, Inc. Meanwhile, in the Landover sanctuary, two services were held with an estimated 300 in attendance.
> 
> While both sides have their interpretations of events, both agree that the issues began to erupt after the death of Peebles’ mother, Dr. Betty P. Peebles, who co-founded the church in 2010. The Board argued that before becoming ill, the late Dr. Peebles had entrusted the affairs of Jericho to the Board, whereas Peebles argued that his mother would have wanted him to be in control.
> 
> Legal battles ensued, including a decision in July 2011 in which a judge from Prince George’s County Circuit Court blocked Peebles from collecting money at Jericho’s services, an amount estimated by one lawyer to be around $300,000 a month.

[Where have we heard this before](http://danstestkitchencom.netfirms.com/wordpress2/2012/03/14/schuller-daughter-to-leave-crystal-cathedral-church/)? And when will people start to get the idea that perhaps churches built on family dynasties aren’t that good an idea?
