[Proverbs 8:1-4, 22-31](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=142267503)

Ever since we held that worship meeting a couple of weeks ago, I have been thinking about the request I received there for “uplifting” sermons. You can tell it’s been working on because I’ve mentioned it once or twice already. Here I am again, talking about the same theme.

It’s not the request that bothers me. I asked people what they wanted. They told me.

But you see, I thought I had been preaching uplifting sermons. I long ago got over the idea that pastors should scold their congregations from the pulpit. Likewise, I put away the notion that sermons ought to be academically respectable, as though we were in a seminary lecture hall, rather than a sanctuary. So while I fully acknowledge that not every sermon is a home run, I thought I’d gotten the hang of giving inspirational sermons. Apparently that is not the case. What gives?

What gives, I think, is that we’ve been working off different understandings of “uplifting.” It might be helpful for me to spell out my assumptions, so that you all know where I’m coming from.

The good news, as I understand it, begins with the proclamation:

> 1. God is powerful.

Proceeding from that, we Christians declare:

> 2. God is free.

This stands to reason, doesn’t it? God is more powerful than any of the powers and principalities that allegedly control the world. He (or she) cannot be tied down by any of them, therefore he (or she) is free.

But wait, there’s more! First,

> 2a. Because God is free, so are we.

and

> 2b. God in freedom chooses us to be the people of God, and wants nothing more in return than for us to choose him in freedom.

This is what it means when we speak of God’s covenant with the people of God. God chooses to be faithful to her people, and wants—but does not force—us to do likewise.

Now, let me pause here to explain something to the confirmands: When you are baptized, it is in part a symbol of the ways in which God chooses you. Those promises that your parents make on your behalf: I will teach this child to turn away from evil, I will raise this child in a Christian community, I will teach him or her about the Christian faith, and so on, all those promises are ways of saying that your parents have chosen God, and they hope that you will too, when you are old enough to do so for yourself. Because God asks—but does not force—you will have the opportunity to make your own decision in the matter. If you so choose, you will confirm the choices your parents made on your behalf, and so continue your journey with God.

If not, well, God bless, and we’ll catch you later.

Either way, God is faithful to God’s own promises, and wants us to choose in freedom to be the people of God. Another way of putting it is that God sets us free to be God’s people. There is no power, no force, that can separate us from God’s loving faithfulness.

The power that the rich have over the poor cannot do it.

The power that those who have strong armies have over unarmed civilians cannot do it.

The power that those who lie in court have over the honest cannot do it.

Hunger can’t do it.

Thirst can’t do it.

Illness can’t do it. Injury can’t do it.

Religious authority cannot do it.

Not even the power of death can separate us from the loving faithfulness of God. None of these things can prevent us from being the people of God.

We are free from these things. But we are also free for God. That freedom for God comes in a particular form: we are free to choose to be in community. More specifically, we are free to choose a life of loving service to our community.

To pull it all together, then:

> 1. God is free. So are we.

> 2. God chooses us. God wants us to choose him (or her).

> 3. God makes us free to choose.

> 4. God wants us to choose community.

And that, my friends, is in a nutshell the uplifting message that I have to offer. The witness of scripture, as I understand it, is that what is important is not that we’re well-adjusted, but that we are free: Free from those things that would keep us from God, and free from those things that would keep us from one another.

So when I preach to you about the power and the necessity of community, I am telling you what I know. God, for me, is available to us through community, and God deploys his power in community. I want you to take that message seriously. I believe, I really do believe, that God works through you to free one another and others from the powers and principalities of the world. I believe that you offer to one another, and to others, the comfort of God. And I believe, I well and truly believe, that the power of God’s love works through your hands.

What a power it is. The book of Proverbs tells us of Wisdom, often identified with the Holy Spirit, who was there with God at the creation, “from the beginning, before the world began.”

“I was there when God set the heavens in place,” Wisdom tells us, and

>        when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,

> when he established the clouds above         

> and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,

> when he gave the sea its boundary        

>  so the waters would not overstep his command,         

> and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.

All that power belongs to God, who is powerful, who is free, and who uses it

> rejoicing in his whole world 

>         and delighting in mankind.

Again, all that power belongs to God, and he uses it in and through the freedom of his loving faithfulness to us.

Once more, all that power belongs to God, and he uses it in and through his body, the community.

You have the power of creation itself at your fingertips. You have the power of God’s freedom. You have the power of God’s love. There is nothing—not oceans or springs or mountains or hills or earth or dust—that can hold you back from God or from one another.

Take that power seriously. Use it to comfort one another, to sustain one another, to love one another, to serve one another, to free one another. Above all else, let that power found in community lift up your hearts and rejoice in it, find hope in it, and give glory to God in it. Amen.
