At the risk of complaining about sour grapes, I want to add a few more thoughts about [Mark Oppenheimer’s review](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/aug/05/changing-the-script-daniel-schultz) of [*Changing the Script*](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Script-Authentically-Progressive-Political/dp/1935439146) in the Guardian. In my view, the “ideological axe” Oppenheimer has to grind has to do with sustaining the prevailing narrative about religion and politics.

In the book, I step out against that narrative rather directly and firmly. It’s easier to distill by telling what I think the religious is *not* about:

- The religious left is not (should not be) about recovering the grand tradition of religious political activism. As grand as it is, very little of it works in today’s environment.

- The religious left is not about creating a coalition between liberals and evangelicals. Nor is about wooing back “Reagan Democrats.” We live in a politically polarized era, which means that it’s smarter to build up one’s own base than try to poach from the other guys’. The idea that the religious left fails if it doesn’t find common cause with evangelicals and socially conservative Catholics is bound to be an exercise in frustration, particularly if the effort is built around “common ground” on abortion. Oppenheimer gets that last part right, at least.

- The religious left is not about reconciliation at the expense of critiquing the systemic forces that keep people down, socially and economically.

- The religious left is not, should not, be obsessed with electoral effectiveness. In fact, it may be most effective *politically* when it is least concerned with being effective *electorally*, and more interested in providing alternatives and change from within the structures that support the current system.

Now, you can disagree with my points if you like. You can say that I failed to sustain an argument in their favor. But that’s not what Oppenheimer does. Instead, he curses me for a dope *because I didn’t make the very points I was arguing against.* Where’s the history? he wants to know. Where are the evangelicals? Where’s the political strategy? In short, I think he wanted me to write [Amy Sullivan’s book](http://www.amazon.com/Party-Faithful-How-Democrats-Closing/dp/0743297865) again instead of my own.

If all of this were simply my griping about a bad review, it wouldn’t be worth your attention. But there is a bigger point here that I wish I could get progressives to understand, whether secular or religious. When people try to put the religious left in a box like this, it’s another form of reflexive hippie-bashing. Everybody knows (he says sarcastically) that this is a center-right nation, and that evangelicals and Catholics dominate the intersection of religion and politics. They have ever since the time of the Puritans, you know. Anybody who disagrees with that assessment is not serious and should be rejected out of hand. The parameters have been set, there is a reason things are the way they are, and that is all you need to know.

So this is in part about maintaining the elite narrative about religion and politics. (I’m speaking in general here; I don’t know Oppenheimer well enough to know how much he buys into what I’ve called elsewhere the “Religion-Industrial Complex,” though his review certainly seems consistent with their narrative.)

I’ve been vocal about how this particular narrative sets opposition to abortion as normative whether or not, you know, people agree with it. But there are other problems with it as well: for one, it sets the glory days of (religious) progressivism in the past, so that we are continually racing to reclaim a lost day, rather than living more realistically into the future.

For another, it subtly denies average people the power to effect change. If you don’t know your history, you’re doomed to repeat it, Oppenheimer seems to be saying. Except the warning comes with the proviso that you need an expert to guide you in understanding your own history, and woe betide you if you act before you know what Serious People know. Don’t think you can change the system, you little upstart. You don’t know enough about the system to know how to begin to change it. Call it [Zeno’s paradox](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/) of politics.

But most serious from my perch as a pastor and gutbucket theologian is that Oppenheimer’s historical perspective ignores the God who announces “Behold, I do a new thing,” upsetting in the process every social norm that ever was. The God Brueggemann knows, and has taught me to see, is one with precious little interest in social stability, who chooses new and surprising ways to accomplish his ends through often unexpected, seemingly powerless and occasionally downright offensive agents. Mark Oppenheimer may think that’s naive and wrongheaded. I suggest he take it up the Lord when he sees him next.
