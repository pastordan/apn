After visiting with us for two days at the start of the week, Callie’s been gone for a few days. We’ve been worried about her, hoping she hadn’t been run over by a car or something like that.

But today Bill was coming back from practicing piano at church again, and she was sitting right where she greeted him the first time. She followed him back to the porch, didn’t seem to know what she wanted more, pets or food. She settled on food.

But she just went around the other side of the house and sat in front of our steps watching the birds and cars go by.

We had to leave ourselves to take Bill to a piano competition in West Bend. He had a little time to practice some more, then went into a room with a judge to play two pieces. It must have gone well, because he came out with a big grin on his face.

I should have saved some calories for Callie. Lord knows she could use them.
