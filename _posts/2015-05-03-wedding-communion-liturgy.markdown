More liturgy: a brief eucharist liturgy developed for a wedding I officiated at today.

The Lord be with you.  
**And also with you.**  
Lift up your hearts.  
**We have them with the Lord.**  
Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.  
**It is right to give him thanks and praise.**

Blessed are you, O God of our ancestors,  
   and blessed is your name in all generations for ever.

Let the heavens and the whole creation bless you for ever.

You made Adam and Eve to be for one another   
  a helper and a support.

From the two of them the human race has sprung.

You said, “It is not good that humans should be alone;  
   let us make helpers for them.”

You seal our hearts for one another with your steadfast love.

You make us strong to love as you have loved us.

In Jesus, the man of Nazareth,   
  who lived and died for us,  
  you made your love for us flesh and blood  
  and made with us a covenant to be joined with you  
  in a marriage that will never end.

We give you thanks for the gift of your love and faithfulness to us even when we have broken faith with you. And so we join with the choirs of angels and saints singing your praise:

**Holy, holy, holy: God of mercy, giver of life;**  
**earth and sky and sea and all that lives**  
**declare your presence and your glory.**

God our Father and Father of our Savior Jesus Christ, accept our words of praise and the promises of love we make today. For recalling what Jesus himself told us, “No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends,” we remember that on the night he was betrayed the Lord Jesus took a loaf + of bread. When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, + after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”

It is our great joy and source of hope to remember all that your son Jesus has done for us. In this meal, we enter into the mystery of your love for us, and the redemption you have promised us at the wedding feast at the end of time. We recall Christ’s life, death, resurrection and ascension and wait for his return in glory.

Send now your Holy Spirit upon these gifts of bread and wine that they might be for us the reality of your unbreakable bond with us, the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all honor and glory are yours, almighty Father, now and forever. Amen.

Invitation

The living bread is broken for the life of the world.  
**Lord, unite us at your table.**

Thanksgiving

God of grace and love, thank you for the bread and the wine we have shared at the table of your son. In these gifts you have joined us together with you and with one another. No one can separate us from your love, and in you we find mercy so that we may grow old together in peace. For all this and much more, we give you our thanks and praise, now and always. **Amen.**
