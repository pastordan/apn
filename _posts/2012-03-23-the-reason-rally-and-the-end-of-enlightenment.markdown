Tomorrow, atheists intend to congregate on the National Mall to celebrate the not-believing lifestyle and such. The forecast is for multiple, severe thunderstorms, which proves that God has a sense of humor, if nothing else.*

I honestly don’t mean to criticize, but I do wonder if some future historian will look back on this event to cite it as the day when our society moved firmly and irrevocably into a post-Enlightenment era. You see, [one of the central focuses of the event is to normalize non-belief:](http://www.npr.org/2012/03/23/149021993/woodstock-for-atheists-a-moment-for-nonbelievers)

In a pure Enlightenment framework, a rally like this wouldn’t be necessarily. The philosophers of the 18th and 19th centuries were confident that individuals could apply reason to moral questions and arrive at truth to guide their actions. Whether it was one or two individuals cogitating out the problem or 30,000 would have been immaterial. The truth is the truth, no matter how many people knew it. And the truth, the advocates of the Enlightenment were firm in saying, always wins eventually.

My atheist friends might object here that it takes courage to be a non-believer in a profoundly godded society like the United States, and courage sometimes needs to be bolstered by numbers. I have no doubt that’s true, and I have said on more than one occasion that I wish it were safer to be a non-believer. (Before anyone asks, yes, I do say that from the pulpit.) But here’s the thing: gathering in numbers to confirm what one believes—or doesn’t believe—is exactly the same logic applied by organized religion. The only intellectually consistent activity the Reason Rally could conduct would be a massive debate on the question of faith. Without the risk of one’s non-belief being disconfirmed, this isn’t so much a “Reason Rally” as happy funtime for atheists.

I hasten to add that there’s nothing wrong with that. Up to 30,000 people will have a lot of fun, give or take the odd thunderbolt, and that’s okay. Everybody play nice if this group should happen to run into a Catholics for freedom to deny sluts birth control rally. Nor should any of this be taken as that old saw about non-belief being a different faith. It’s just that as atheism develops as an organized movement, it will inevitably take on some of the same characteristics as other organized movements dealing with ultimate questions, those structures we conventionally call “religion.” Again, that doesn’t make atheism any better or worse than having faith. It simply means that it is not as categorically distinct as many non-believers—or believers, for that matter—would have you think.

*Tip o’ the pin to Diana Butler Bass on that one. I’m sure Diana would look at what I’ve just said and posit the “nones” or [“spiritual-but-not-religious”](http://www.dianabutlerbass.com/books-mainmenu-4) types as a kind of third way between religion and atheism that does a bang-up, postmodern job of making a hash out of the two categories.
