Look, the way things work is this: it takes a big personality to grow a mega-church. But big personalities tend not to play well with others, and when things don’t go well, well…witness [Robert H. and Arvella Schuller’s departure from the board of the Crystal Cathedral](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-schullers-20120310,0,7038703.story):

> Schuller; his wife, Arvella; their daughter Carol Schuller Milner; and her husband, Timothy Milner, allege that the church owes them money for copyright infringement, intellectual property violations and unpaid contracts.
> 
> “We cannot continue to serve on the board in what has become an adversarial and negative atmosphere especially since it now seems that it will not be ending any time soon,” Arvella Schuller said in a statement Saturday.
> 
> Sorting through competing financial claims has delayed $12.5 million in payments to some church creditors and could threaten the church’s ability to continue its ministries, including the “Hour of Power” broadcasts.

The Cathedral itself has been sold to the Catholic Diocese of Orange, but the creditors will apparently have to wait until things get sorted out with the Schullers. It could be a while.

Schuller was once called [“an evangelist with a gospel.”](http://www.religionnewsblog.com/22854/robert-schuller) That might explain the concluding paragraph of the story:

> The creditors committee has alleged that the church ministry, of which family members are a part, has borrowed money from an endowment fund and continued to receive generous salaries and perks even as the church struggled financially.

It’s not mine to judge, and yes, if I were leaving my church, I’d want to make sure that I got paid according to the agreement. Still, the thought does occur to me that the Crystal Cathedral might not be in such trouble with a pastor who knew what it meant that foxes have holes, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.
