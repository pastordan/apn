Callie’s babies have their eyes open now, and at least one of them (the orange tabby) has his purr on. They are just sweet as the dickens.

Mama Callie is a different story. She’s been whining around trying to get into the house again. Yesterday, she spotted Zippy in the kitchen from the back step and went on the attack. I had to chase her out of the kitchen so she didn’t eat the poor cat alive. Callie’s also had some epic stare-downs with the Brindle Baby, who used to be her friend. We’re wondering if we’ll have to move Callie off the porch, maybe out to the garage or somewhere. She’s getting a bit territorial.

In other developments, the Brindle Baby let Jen pet her a little last night. I tried later on, but she kept getting startled. She got pretty close to me, though. I’ll see if we can’t get some photos.
