Q. [Do Wisconsin recall primary results bode ill for unions?](http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20120510/FON0101/120510017/1985)

A. No. While the decision to go all-in on Falk was a bit unwise (though equally inevitable), the unions will find the extra money to support Barrett, and their members will have no problem volunteering on his behalf. Both measures will ensure that Barrett has to pay attention to the unions. They may be modestly worse off than under a Falk administration, but theyâ€™ll certainly better off than under Walker.
