Dear Everybody:

Sermons are something like jellyfish: they’re exciting when you first meet them, but they’re not very portable. For that reason, I’ve always been reluctant to try to recycle my Sunday-morning writings. They don’t translate well to new environments—like the jellyfish, they lose their sting pretty quickly, and they tend to get a bit nebulous when you take them out of context. Also, despite what Barbara Brown Taylor might tell you, sermons cannot be written to be read and re-read. Taking away their oral nature makes them essays, not sermons. On the other hand, I’ve been overrun with a veritable pestilence of paperwork the past couple of days, and it seems like last week’s sermon has already staked a claim to most of what today’s Notebook entry would have said. Were it an Old West miner, my last sermon would by now be stamping down “NO TRESPASSING” signs around its section of creekbed and leveling its shotgun at any interlopers fool enough to press in on its turf. Out of self-preservation, then, if not sheer laziness, I’ll defer to the obvious choice and let the sermon speak for the Notebook this week. Barring any more deaths in the congregation, I swear that next week’s topic will have nothing to do with grief.

 By way of introduction, the text at hand for this sermon was Isaiah 40:1-11. Its spark was the death of another man in our congregation on Friday the 3rd, just two days after we buried Dick Graham. I began by pointing to a menorah I had used in the children’s sermon.

===============================================================

 

I guess I brought in the menorah today because I felt like we could use a little extra light around here. You see, I was here on Wednesday morning for Dick Graham’s funeral service, along with quite a few other people from the congregation. The funeral directors were supposed to close the casket before the public viewing began, but Betty asked them to leave it open so that one last relative could say her goodbyes. By the time she showed up, Dick’s friends and fellow church-goers were here, so Betty and her son Jeff decided to simply leave the casket open for the public viewing as well.  
 Which was fine, except that it led to the awkward situation of the funeral directors having to wrap the body in its shroud and close the casket before the entire congregation. I don’t think I was quite as put off by this as some folks were; I was more temporarily stymied by it. How odd, I thought, that this man that I loved and spent so much time talking to should now be permanently sealed in a box and consigned to the mercy of the earth. The image of that coffin lid swinging shut brings home what the voice cries out in Isaiah:

All mankind is grass,  
and all their glory like the flower of the field.  
The grass withers, the flower wilts,  
when the breath of the Lord blows upon it.

This was my eighth funeral service, but the first where I could honestly say I was burying a friend, someone I knew well. Death becomes more real when it’s someone you know.

 I had just begun to pull myself back together, gird my loins, as it were, when I got a call from Sally on Friday evening. Jesse Marquart’s family had been in touch with her, looking for me. He had been on the operating table since seven o’clock Friday morning, had been transfused several times, but had lost all the blood again. Things looked bad. Would I come to Hershey Medical Center as soon as I could?

 I did. The information center sent me up to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, and I made my way to a nurse’s station, where they told me that he was in Unit 1, Bed 3. “Uh-oh,” said one nurse. “Do you know the situation?” the other said.

 “I know that he’s been bleeding all day,” I replied.

 “He’s passed on,” she said. “The family is in the room with him.”

 The other nurse took me over to the room, made sure that it was all right for me to come in before she stepped out of the doorway. Most of the family was there: Jesse’s wife Elsie, his sisters Kitty and Jessie Bemis, Kitty’s daughter Susie. An aunt and uncle were in a consultation room with Jesse’s son and daughter. The surgeon and a chaplain were in the room with us. Apparently, I had missed his death by only minutes.

 I’ll leave the details of the family’s grief out of it. You can probably imagine the scene for yourself—you yourself may have even gone through a similar situation. Let me put it like this: we cried, we prayed, we talked about practical matters. It took a long time for the hospital mortuary staff to show up. I went to talk to the chaplain, who was trying to find the mortician. She hung up the phone and assured me he was on his way, that the family could leave soon. For some reason-—curiosity, duty, whatever—I felt compelled to take one last look at Jesse before we left. To my surprise, they had already put him in a body bag. It looked impossibly small and delicate for such a big man. I thought again about what a strange thing death was.

 At moments like these, a believer is tempted to think very bad thoughts. Even a pastor can’t help shaking his head in disbelief. At that moment of death—the moment where it really stings, not necessarily at the exact moment when the heart stops and the brain waves cease—we are tempted to lose our faith, to cry out that God cannot possibly be good and great. For if God were good, it seems to us, he would not take a loving, gentle father in his fifty-third year of life. And if God were great, he would not allow a decent, constant friend to all who met him to suffer a prolonged and bitter death. What are we to say in the darkness of grief? What light can we turn to? What light will shine in our faces and give us the courage and the assurance that we need to grieve as believers, and not as those who are without hope?

 The answer, my friends, comes slowly. For Dick and for Jesse, the days of exile are at an end. They have gone home to their dear Lord and Savior. They have been spoken to tenderly and received the good news that their sins have been forgiven and that their service is at an end. It is we who are left in the aftermath, confused and aimless. It is we who must return to the land of the living, it is we who are grieving. It is we who need to hear that we have received from the hand of the Lord double for all our sins, and it is we who must hear the command to prepare the way of the Lord, to make straight in the wasteland a highway for our God! For what is this time of grief and desolation, friends, if not a wasteland? We are faced now with the task of rebuilding our lives in the face of grief—that is to say, to rebuild our lives with what seems like fewer and fewer friends and loved ones every day. If there is a person in this congregation who has not been touched by the darkness of grief this year, I have yet to meet them.

 And yet, we hear today the promises of God:

> Every valley shall be filled in,  
> every mountain and hill shall be made low;  
> The rugged land shall be made a plain,  
> the rough country, a broad valley.  
> Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,  
> and all mankind shall see it together;  
> for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

Not to put too fine a point on it, God will bulldoze this wasteland that we are in, and turn it from an uninhabitable desert to a lush, even comfortable plain, green and fertile and full of life. All appearances to the contrary, God is great, because God’s greatness lies in the power to create and sustain life despite the reality of death, not in overcoming or erasing death itself. That we live beyond the span of the dead, that we eventually find some measure of comfort and renewal after their passing, is testimony to God’s greatness. Though the grass withers and the flower wilts, the word of our God—which is a word of life and survival despite death—that word stands forever.

 Therefore, Isaiah tells us, we are commanded to spread the good news of our God:

> Go up onto a high mountain,  
> Zion, herald of glad tidings;  
> Cry out at the top of your voice,  
> Jerusalem, herald of good news!  
> Fear not to cry out   
>  and say to the cities of Judah:  
> Here is your God!

Or in the Christian equivalent:

> Go, tell it on the mountain,  
>  Over the hills and everywhere!  
> Go, tell it on the mountain,  
>  That Jesus Christ our Lord is born!

It is no accident that we read this passage this morning, on the second Sunday of Advent. And I think it is no accident either that Hannukah roughly coincides with Advent. The confession of Christian believers, the assurance that gives them hope, is that Jesus Christ is the very embodiment of the power of God the father. And in the same way that Jews remember in light the steadfast faithfulness of a God who would not abandon them to their enemies, so we remember in our own God’s faithfulness. For God too sent us a light, and a powerful light to boot. Only our belief is that God sent to us light in the form of a man who was born, lived, and died among us.

 Our belief is that God’s power is perfected in love, that the same power that could restore the exiles of Israel to Jerusalem is the power that stands with us in our moment of emptiness and need, that the same power that could level the desert stood with us, not avoiding the pain and the shame of the cross, but despising it, that the same power of the Lord who rules by his strong arm is the power that loves us like a shepherd who feeds his flock—and let me tell you, that Good Shepherd continues to feed his flock today on the altar.

> In his arms he gathers the lambs,  
> carrying them in his bosom,  
> and leading the ewes with care.

Christ may have gathered Dick Graham and Jesse Marquart back to him; he may be—he is, I’m sure—carrying them in his arms at this very moment. But he also leads his ewes with care, so that we too may give birth. If you follow the analogy out, it would be so that we could become as mothers to more lambs, and I’m sure that’s part of God’s sustaining work. But more to the point, so that we can give birth to the kind of compassion and love that we ought to have in leading lives of holiness and godliness.

 You see, God’s power is perfected in love, and that love was born in the form of a humble man of Nazareth. And now our hope, our assurance, our faith, our light, consists in this: that that light will return to us soon and very soon. And when he comes, he will baptize us in a new spirit, and then he will transform the world as we know it. This is the message of Advent: that God is good, and God is great, and God is going to return to us in power and love and light. Come, Lord Jesus! Come quickly!
