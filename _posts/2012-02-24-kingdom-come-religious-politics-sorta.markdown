I linked a bit of this piece by [[D]mergent’s josephpusateri](http://dmergent.org/2012/02/23/everything-canmustwill-change-now) on Twitter yesterday. It’s so good I’m going to post a little longer excerpt below and say, really, [read the whole thing](http://dmergent.org/2012/02/23/everything-canmustwill-change-now/).

> The living God has heard the cry of the poor.  And the living God is bringing the Kingdom in our midst.  What God has to say, God says specifically to the poor (Isa 61:1-3, Luke 4:16-21).  When we are finally crushed too, then we will hear, maybe for the first time, what God has to say.
> 
> Of course, we don’t have to wait until then.  We could choose to hear it now:  Everything has to change.
> 
> The Kingdom of God is the point.  The Kingdom of God is God’s answer to injustice, to suffering, to the cries of her people.  When Jesus of Nazareth preached on this earth, he announced that the Kingdom was in our midst.  He healed the broken and sick.  And the ethics of the Kingdom he described were foreign and backwards to anything we can imagine.  A worker who labors for one hour is paid the same as one who works for eight (Matt 20:1-16)?  The last shall be first and the first shall be last?  Are you kidding me?  The prostitutes and tax-collectors, the drug-dealers and predators are getting into heaven before the religious people?  Before the philanthropists?  When the empire finally nailed this peasant to a cross, God revealed that her love will resurrect even that which the empire lawfully executes.
> 
> We literally cannot imagine what the Kingdom looks like, and we literally cannot bring it.  The Kingdom is not the fruit of pious, conservative Bible thumpers, or of compassionate, white liberals.  The Kingdom comes from God and it belongs to the poor, the silenced, the powerless, the abused, the shit-on, the screw-ups, those for whom the privileged, conservative, liberal, whatever, claim to know what’s best.

Marvelous.
