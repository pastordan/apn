- The biggest surprise of this story—other than that [prisoners will try to save one another’s lives](http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20120223/FON0101/202230458/1985)—is in the second-to-last graf. I guess I knew that, but it’s still a bit of a shock.
- [This has to be painful](http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2012/02/22/rhode-island-cathedral-to-suspend-services-on-financial-grounds/).
- I’m not qualified to judge, and perhaps any Catholic readers out there could help me out, but it seems to me in this situation, [the priest is right](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/23/rev-william-rowe-fired-catholic-priest-mass-prayers_n_1294769.html). Matching prayers to the preaching is a well-established liturgical practice, and isn’t the whole idea of the Catholic to be, well, catholic? The Vatican seems determined to be more top-down than ever these days. Well, I wish Father Rowe a happy retirement or a wonderful new career, whichever comes first.
- [This is just awful](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-indianapolis-church-drowningtre81m08s-20120222,0,4727702.story). It’s easy to judge at a distance, of course, but I do have to ask: why was the pool left uncovered, especially with children around? And why did no one immediately notice that the kid had wandered off?
- I think the Christian Post misunderstands what’s going on in the [Presbyterian church upholding its censure of a “lesbian evangelist”](http://www.christianpost.com/news/censure-on-lesbian-evangelist-affirmed-by-pcusa-70089/):  
> “The issue is not simply the same-sex ceremony. It is the misrepresentation that the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) recognizes the ceremony and the resulting relationship to be a marriage in the eyes of the church,” read the majority opinion.“So the critical question is not whether the definitional language creates proscribed conduct, it is whether it is permissible to represent that one is doing something which one cannot constitutionally do.”

That doesn’t sound like a ringing endorsement of “traditional” marriage. Sounds more like somebody saying “rules are rules, whether we agree with them or not.” To be fair, the article does include some of differing opinions on the ruling a little farther down.
- [Well, yes](http://www.christianpost.com/news/is-santorum-falling-into-a-theology-trap-70081/):  
> Peter Wehner, a former deputy assistant to President George H.W. Bush and now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, offered some advice to the former Pennsylvania Senator in his Wednesday column in Commentary magazine.“He’s (Santorum) been quite forthright in his views against homosexual acts, about women in combat, and about women in the workforce,” Wehner wrote. “He’s given a speech in which he’s said Satan has systematically targeted the key institutions in American life.”
> 
> “The danger for Santorum is that, fairly or not, these statements and stands, separately and (especially) combined, create a portrait of a person who is censorious and sits in critical judgment of the lifestyle of most Americans,” he warned.
