It’s really tempting to allow [this article from the Breitbart borg](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/03/20/Ann-Curry-Ambush-Kirk-Cameron) to mock itself. It would save me a headache:

> Make no mistake about it, this is all about going after the Christian Church. Same-sex marriage, GLAAD’s fascist rampages, and all of this Orwellian political correctness is part of long-term goal — and that’s to make Christian beliefs a form of bigotry and to force a left-wing agenda on the church all under a Trojan horse labelled “discrimination.”

The stupid, it burns. Here’s how the logic (such as it is) proceeds:

> The obvious next step will be to attempt an end-run around the First Amendment by declaring as bigoted the Church’s refusal to marry same-sex couples. They will also attempt to declare as hate speech any belief held by the church that in any way angers GLAAD.

For one thing, which Christian church are we talking about here? Because my Christian church (parts of it, anyway) are pretty gay-friendly. And somehow, we’ve jumped from “making Catholic hospitals let somebody else pay for their employees’ birth control is a violation of religious freedom”—-which is something of a stretch in itself—to “obviously this means that we’ll all be lined up and forced into gay orgy indoctrination boot camps, obviously.” What the—?

It goes on from there to charge Ann Curry with sticking a knife in poor Kirk Cameron’s throat and making him pledge allegiance to the United States of Ellen, or something. In fact, she’s asking some very reasonable questions: some people think you’re using hate speech. What do you have to say to that? Are you sure your language isn’t encouraging people to look down on gays and lesbians? But apparently, unless you’re agreeing with Cameron, you’re attacking him. Or something.

Ordinarily, I’d just come up with a quick, witty put-down and be done with it. The only reason I bring this up at such length is: [hate speech](http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/republican-base-exposed-by-davidoatkins.html), look at who’s doing it. There is some very ugly stuff coming out these days, both racially and sexually. In the long term, it’s going to do nothing to help conservatives maintain any kind of power. The more of this crap that goes around, the more it alienates them from the mainstream of society. In the short run, woof. Ugly, ugly, ugly.
