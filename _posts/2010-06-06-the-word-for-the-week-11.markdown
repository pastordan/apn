[1 Kings 17:8–24 & Luke 7:11-17](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=145608192)

Paula Anderson, the pastor at Campbellsport, told me a good one the other day. Well, a “good” one. It goes like this: Batman and Robin decided to take a break from fighting crime one weekend. They packed up their gear and went off in the Batmobile to the nearest state park to go camping. They went hiking, they went fishing, they sat around the campfire and roasted marshmallows. At the end of a long day, they turned in and went to bed in their sleeping bags.

About three o’clock in the morning, Batman woke Robin up. “Tell me, old chum,” he said, “what’s the first thing you notice?”

Robin said, “Well, Batman, it’s a beautiful night. I can see Orion and Cassiopeia, and even the Milky Way. Judging by the breeze, it’s going to be cooler tomorrow, but it’s not going to rain.”

“Robin, my fine young friend,” said Batman, “you’re an idiot. Somebody stole our tent.”

It must be in the telling.

Anyway. All of this is a longish way of saying that it’s possible to overthink things sometimes. That’s definitely the case with scripture. The details can overwhelm you and distract you for from the larger picture.

So it is that I want to make just a few simple points about this morning’s lessons. Three, in fact.

One: **God provides for the people of God, often in surprising ways.** Just before our Old Testament lesson begins, the prophet Elijah runs into trouble with King Ahab. What I really mean is that Ahab and his faithless administration have received a vote of “no confidence” from God, and Elijah has confronted him. God intends to force regime change by way of a drought that Elijah calls down upon Ahab.

Following God’s instructions, Elijah flees to a *wadi*, a river bed that dries up in season. There, ravens bring him “bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening.” When the river bed dries up, God sends Elijah on to a most unexpected source of food: a widow and her son who are themselves on the brink of starvation. Elijah makes no effort to get her to change plans. In fact, he piles on, asking for a little cake (unleavened bread), even before she and her child are fed! But he does assure her that God says she will not run out of food. Remarkably, she trusts him, and God provides the sustenance they need.

…And that’s where things take a turn for the weird. Lesson number two is that **God wants us to live**, but that’s not how it seems. After the miracle of the feeding, the widow’s son promptly dies. Even Elijah seems taken aback by this turn of events, exclaiming, “O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?” God, we did what you asked, and this is how you repay us?

Well, apparently it is, but it is also an opportunity for Elijah to perform another miracle. God hears his pleas and restores the boy to life.

The whole story seems odd. Why would God take the son’s life? Why would he give it back so quickly? Did he change his mind? Did he make a mistake? It only begins to make sense when we remember that this widow is a resident of Sidon, in what is today part of Lebanon. That is to say, she is not a Jew, and has no reason to place her trust in Elijah’s God. She could have chosen to say “no” to God, and let his prophet starve. God is willing to take a chance on her free will, to risk the possibility that she might choose self-preservation over generosity. Yet she does have faith, in Elijah and in the God he represents, and she says “yes.” So where the people of Israel—God’s people—have rejected his messenger, here a foreigner accepts him and trusts in his message. God rewards her faith, even in the most surprising of places and people. The point is clear, then. God wants us to have fullness of life, no matter who we are.

That brings us to lesson three: **Jesus is the new Elijah, and more**. Obviously, Luke’s story of Jesus raising the man at Nain parallels the story of Elijah and the widow’s son. That’s not an accident. Luke was at some pains to portray Jesus as a new and authoritative prophet, more powerful than even Elijah, the greatest prophet Israel had known. The irony here is that where the Jewish Elijah works wonders with an unexpectedly faithful gentile, Jesus is the unexpected healer of a Jewish man. In other words, the challenging surprise in Luke’s story is not who *gets* healed, but who *does* the healing.

Yet God still rewards the faith of his people. Even when it seems too late for a miracle, God brings life out of death. What connects Elijah and Jesus, and what allows them to tap into God’s surprising power, is their humble trust in God’s love and faithfulness. Elijah goes where God tells him and does what God asks him. When God throws him a curveball, he doesn’t lose faith. He throws himself (and the widow’s son) on God’s mercy. Jesus likewise trusts in God’s steadfast love, but as God’s very Son, he can exert the Lord’s power for himself. He is more than just a prophet: he is God incarnate. Therefore, more trust and hope can be placed in him than even the greatest of prophets.

So there you have it: God provides for the people of God, often in surprising ways; God wants us to live; and Jesus is the new Elijah, and more. That’s all very nice, but what does it mean for us?

In a time of unemployment that is officially at 9.5% and more realistically 16.6%, when the average time of unemployment has doubled to 34 weeks, when workers over the age of 45 are more likely to be unemployed and more likely to stay unemployed, and when some companies literally will not take applications from those out of work, it means that God will find some way to provide for those who have little or nothing. It may not be a way that we are anticipating. It may not be a way that we are comfortable with. But those who trust in God—no matter who they are—those who are desperate enough to risk it all for God, they will have food enough to get them through.

It means, as millions upon millions of barrels of oil spill into the Gulf of Mexico topped by millions more gallons of toxic dispersants, creating an unprecedented ecological disaster, that God will find a way to bring new life out of death and environmental destruction, even though it looks like it is too late for the waters and the marshes and the bayous.

And it means today as always that in Jesus Christ we have a prophet and more. We have a God whose heart goes out to us, who hears us when we cry, and who comes to help and to save his people. God intends for us to have fullness of life, no matter who we are, and is willing to take risky action to see that we have it. That, I think, is cause for celebration. Amen.
