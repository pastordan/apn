title: Strong, Silent Men Suck At Asking For Help—Especially In Rural Areas

Turns out [some stereotypes are true](http://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/rural-men-avoid-counseling-0127120/):

> Men, in general, are far less likely than women to seek professional help for mental health problems. But a new study, led by Joseph H. Hammer and David L. Vogel of the Department of Psychology at Iowa State University, suggests that men from rural communities are even more resistant than urban-dwelling men when it comes to getting psychological counseling. The study expands upon previous research by the team and explores the factors that create barriers to treatment. For example, in the study, Hammer and colleagues identified self-stigma as the primary reason that men from rural areas do not reach out for help.

> Masculine norms of success, power, emotional control, and self-reliance are evident throughout Western cultures. In America, men are taught early on the significance of these norms. Asking for help and showing emotional vulnerability is perceived as a sign of weakness and often makes young boys the target of ridicule by family members or peers. To avoid this victimization, young boys and teens will resort to internalizing and will transfer external stigmas regarding counseling to themselves as self-stigmas.

I don’t know about the ridicule part, but it’s definitely true in this part of the country that men are raised to be self-reliant. Whenever there’s a problem, the first response to an offer of help will be “I can handle it.” That’s true of both the men and women around here, actually. The women at least talk about how they feel, though. The men would rather die than express a feeling that wasn’t related to the Packers or the indescribable agony of [insert mundane yard chore here]. These days, they teach kids to open up a little at school, but the older you get, the more entrenched you tend to be in this culture. I’m not even sure some of the elderly men in my congregation know they have feelings, much less how to express them. And since you can barely poke and prod them into seeing a specialist for medical problems, forget trying to get them to talk to a psychiatrist or a counselor without a court order. They *might* talk to me in sort of general terms, but I’ve only been here five years, and I’m young enough to be their grandson in many cases. No way are they forming a therapeutic alliance with me or anybody else.

To be (more) serious about this, the inability to get rural men to seek mental health treatment fuels their [extraordinarily high suicide rate](http://www.dailyyonder.com/booze-guns-and-rise-rural-suicides/2009/09/22/2358). It also causes some of the alcoholism that seems to be an epidemic here.

And let’s not kid ourselves: life for a rural man can be hard. Jobs are often demanding, not necessarily high-paying, and far away, while housing prices are high and come with a lot of unpaid work. There’s a lot of isolation and distance from services, and a lot of pressure to play the traditional role that’s been assigned to you.

I try hard to take away as much of the stigma about mental illness as I can in my congregation. Just talking about my own struggles with bipolar disorder helps. So does talking about mental health in sermons and with parishioners. I have often felt like there’s more I could be doing, though. It might be time to check into some of it.
