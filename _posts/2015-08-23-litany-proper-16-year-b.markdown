Just a litany today:

In peace and for the peace of the world, let us pray to the Lord.

*Silent prayer*

For those whose memories falter, those whose minds are afflicted, and those whose brains suffer, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

For the people of New Orleans and their region, as they continue to recover from Hurricane Katrina and rebuild their lives after many years, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

For the brokenhearted, the lonely, and those crushed in spirit, that God hear their cries and offer them peace and comfort, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

For those who struggle to commit themselves to the ways of God, for those who try to serve two masters, and for ourselves as we seek to grow in faith and discipleship, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

For those who seek freedom from oppression and abuse, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

For rains to water crops, extinguish fires, and relieve drought, and for the nations of the world that they exercise all wisdom and insight in addressing global climate change, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

For those whose bones are broken, those who are ill, whose health falters, for those whose bellies are empty, that they know God’s overflowing grace and generosity, and that they be fed with the bread of life, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

For the dead and the dying, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

For our church, as it walks through its time of transition, and for the pastor who is even now being prepared to be called to this community, Let us pray to the Lord. **Lord, hear our prayer.**

Lord hear our prayer, for we pray to you as Christ has taught us, saying:

The Lord’s Prayer   
*Our Father, who art in Heaven,*  
*  hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come,*  
*Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.*  
*Give us this day our daily bread,*  
*  and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.*  
*And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,*  
*  for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,*  
*  forever and ever. Amen.*
