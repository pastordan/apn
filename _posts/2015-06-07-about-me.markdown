1. You have been warned.
2. I write at least sometimes for Religion Dispatches, the Christian Century and here at my own blog. Sometimes I write at other places, but it’s been a while.
3. I wrote a book once. It didn’t do very well. Go [buy a copy](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Script-Authentically-Progressive-Political/dp/1935439146) and make my publisher happy.
4. I swear. A lot. I do not apologize for this.
5. I like cookies. A lot. Also, beer. No, no apologies for this, either.
6. In fact, I proactively offer up no apologies for any topics covered on my Twitter feed or in my blog. I do, however, sometimes say stupid things. Sorry.
7. The opinions stated in this Twitter feed or in any of my writing are mine and mine alone. They do not represent the views of any of my employers, or the members of any church I happen to be serving. If you think you can make a successful complaint to the IRS about any of the things I say, you are an idiot.
8. Do I even have to explain the retweets things? Don’t be an idiot.
9. You have been warned.
