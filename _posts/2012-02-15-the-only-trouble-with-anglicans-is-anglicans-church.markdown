I said last night that I’d try to answer Jim Naughton’s question, [“What is wrong with The Episcopal Church?”](http://www.episcopalcafe.com/lead/episcopal_church/what_is_wrong_with_the_episcop.html) That I will.

I’m no expert, of course, but from the perspective of a friendly outsider a few things come immediately to mind. The Episcopal Church is the remnant of a once-established church that traveled around the globe on the back of the British Empire. That led to great growth, naturally, and lasting influence disproportionate to its size. But it also left a church spread somewhat thin all over the place. And when the top-down control was removed and provincial churches became self-governing, it left a wide disparity in church ethos.

Perhaps the easiest way to understand what I’m getting at here is by resorting to analogy to other churches. My own UCC has the luxury of being based heavily in the Northeast and the Upper Midwest. There are a few pockets here and there, but for the most part, that’s it. So when the church tries to formulate a social stance, they can do so from a relatively uniform perspective. There’s always somebody who objects, but by now, most of the hard-core conservatives have selected themselves out. That leaves room to develop a coherent identity. The United Methodist Church, by way of contrast, is split almost right down the middle. About half its members live in the Deep South, and about half are spread around the rest of the nation. They can’t do *anything* without half the people getting mad. The Episcopal Church is like that in the US, and around the world. Wherever you turn, there’s somebody there to tell you you’re doing the wrong thing. And because TEC values its global connections, they actually listen to the wankers in Recife and Burundi and wherever the hell it is those Alpha nutjobs are from. It doesn’t help that the Archbishop of Canterbury is so eager to keep the peace that he lets said wankers yammer on and on and on even to the detriment of the American church. It’s a wonder Episcopalians don’t dissolve in a big puddle of neuroses. More often, anyway.

Speaking of the pointy-headed prelates in Recife and Burundi (and Entebbe, and…), another problem with The Episcopal Church is the bishops. As I understand it, TEC invests in them the principle of unity, and the work of making that principle real. In other words, at least one of the things that keeps Episcopalians and Anglicans together is that their many bishops work together to create a single, global ministry. The only trouble is, it doesn’t work. Catholics have the same idea, but they have a strong figure at the top to enforce the principle and adjudicate disputes. Lutherans and Methodists have a relatively weak primate, but they’re bound together by their respective theologies. Other churches, like the UCC, gather around specific ideas. We’re kept together by a commitment to radical openness. I have no idea what the hell unites Presbyterians.

The other problem with placing the work of unity in a *person* rather than an *idea* is that sometimes the person isn’t very popular. Women bishops drive conservatives crazy, but they’ve gotten used to them, more or less. Gay bishops send them into orbit. I can’t wait to see their heads explode when the first transgender bishop comes along.

This is all very unfortunate, in that bishops are considered to be direct descendants and continuers of the ministry of Jesus Christ himself. Mighty tough to give up on that act. All I can say is that Christ wasn’t expecting to win any popularity contests.

The last obstacle to the success of TEC that I can see is the Book of Common Prayer. It’s got some lovely stuff in it. It’s also tough to understand, tougher to follow, and utterly unlike the contemporary liturgy of any other church. The damn thing even *looks* old. Combined with high church, “smells and bells” worship style, it sends a strong signal that TEC is run by and for pretentious, overeducated twits who really, *really* think that matching the wine with the brie is necessary for salvation.

Now, I know what you’re going to say: C’mon, that’s a stereotype. There’s plenty of good, humble Episcopalians. Exactly. The Book of Common <strike>Worship</strike> Prayer contributes to a perception that the church is stuffy, snobbish, and out-of-touch. At least that’s true in the US, I’m not sure of other countries. There’s some wonderful new liturgy put out by the Church of England, I steal from it all the time. But until it works its way through the wider church, and until TEC finds some ways of shaking its stodgy image through more user-friendly worship, the Book of Common <strike>Worship</strike> Prayer is going to be as much a barrier as an attractor.

To review, what’s wrong with The Episcopal Church? Well, its heritage, its bishops, and its book of worship. So, pretty much everything that makes it what it is. But don’t despair, I’m sure it’ll all work out one way or another. TEC really just needs to find a way to figure out how to bring its treasures into a new generation, same as any other communion. Besides, it has the whole “saved by grace with taste” thing locked down. And it could be worse: it could the product of a mixed marriage. Say, a bunch of fuddy-duddy Germans stuck with *Congregationalists*. Pray for us.

*Updated per RevBindy in the comments. Aaaand thank you for proving my point for me.
