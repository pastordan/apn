Figured I might as well go ahead and upload [the complete liturgy for this coming Sunday](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fbe2x5yz4a7vph/Good%20Shepherd%20Liturgy.pdf). (This is my pastoral “cheat sheet,” which is more complete than what the congregation sees.) Enjoy, and feel free to use. Though if you’re just getting around to the bulletin on Thursday afternoon, you probably have bigger problems to attend to…
