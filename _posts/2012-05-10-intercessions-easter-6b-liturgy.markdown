Better late than never. These are structured around the [Song of St. Anselm](http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/newpatterns/sampleservicescontents/npw14.aspx), which the Church of England suggests as a hymn for Mothering Sunday. As you’ll see, I’ve taken a snippet from the song and written an intercession to go along with it. I’ve also borrowed some verbs from [the lesson for the day](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=203681438).

You can find the pretty copy [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4mdrum7ll3val0p/Easter%206B%20Intercessions.pdf).

<div style="text-align: center;">+++</div>Gather your little ones to you, O God, as a hen gathers her brood, and hear the prayers we lift to you as a mother hears her child.

<div style="text-align: center;">Silent Prayer</div>“Jesus, like a mother you gather your people to you; you are gentle with us as a mother with her children.”

> —Teach us to accept all our brothers and sisters for who they are: your beloved children. Speak to us your word of gentleness.

“Often you weep over our sins and pride, tenderly you draw us from hatred and judgment.”

> —Turn us from back-biting, smugness, superiority, and all the ways we go wrong in thinking we are better than one another. Let your Spirit of humility fall upon us.

“You comfort us in sorrow and bind up our wounds; in sickness you nurse us, and with pure milk you feed us.”

> —Form us in your own image, forgive us our sins, make us whole, and nourish us with the message of the gospel. Help us to hear the good news of Easter.

“Jesus, by your dying we are born to new life; by your anguish and labor we come forth in joy.”

> —Take care of the dying: strengthen their lives, reassure them of your presence, and renew in their bodies the promise of the resurrection. Console all those who mourn, and let them know their struggles’ end in the heavenly joy that has no end. Astound us with the life that is to come.

“Despair turns to hope through your sweet goodness; through your gentleness we find comfort in fear.”

> —Let the poor know that tomorrow will be better than today; let the anxious know that they will never be alone. Pour out your Holy Spirit of love upon our hearts.

“Your warmth give life to the dead, your touch makes sinners righteous.”

> —Breathe new life into this congregation, and make us not just people who are closer to one another, but better people. Baptize our hearts, that we who believe in Christ Jesus may receive forgiveness of sins in his name.

“Lord Jesus, in your mercy heal us; in your love and tenderness remake us.”

> —We pray for healing especially for…that they may know your merciful care. We pray for love and tenderness for ourselves, Jesus our brother and mother, that our hearts might be changed. Invite us into the life you have promised.

“In your compassion bring grace and forgiveness, for the beauty of heaven may your love prepare us.”

> —Let your mercy linger in our hearts like friends at table. Help us to see that the beauty of heaven is made of all the faces gathered there. Help us to know your loving relief at seeing all your little ones together with you and the Father for all eternity. Stay with us, God.

Stay with us, O God, for we cry out to God our Father and Mother, and we pray as Christ our brother taught us, saying…

> *Our Father, who art in Heaven,  
>    hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come,  
> Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.  
> Give us this day our daily bread,  
>    and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  
> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,  
>    for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,  
>    forever and ever. Amen.*
