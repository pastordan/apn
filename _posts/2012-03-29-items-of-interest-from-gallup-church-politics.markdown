title: Items Of Interest From Gallup [Church] [Politics]

Gallup, as you may or may not know, has a longtime commitment to collecting data on religious trends in the US. As it happens, they just released two interesting releases in the past few days.

The first, [ranking states from most religious to least](http://www.gallup.com/poll/153479/Mississippi-Religious-State.aspx#2), needs little in the way of explanation. Just as you might expect, the most religious states clump in the old Confederacy plus Utah and West Virginia. And just as you might expect, the *least* religious states clump in the Northeast and West. The Midwest is in the middle, as always.

There’s really no surprises in any of that. I will simply repeat a few cautions I throw out whenever this kind of data comes out:

1. While there is a high correlation between religion and voting patterns, high religiosity for a state is not identical with being a Republican stronghold, and vice versa. West Virginia almost always goes Democratic, while Vermont and Wyoming almost always go Republican. Mississippi, meanwhile, is Mississippi, as always.
2. Religiosity is not the same thing as morality. What these patterns show are *cultural* variations, not changes in Who Has God and Who Does Not. Anyone who tells you different can bit my shiny metal you-know-what.
3. One of the reasons I put out 2. above is that Gallup measures religious *participation*, not religious *affiliation*. If you ask people what church they’re affiliated with, rather than how often they go to church, you get a different picture of the nation. It’s not completely different, but it does collapse some of the differences between the South and the Midwest. (Which is another way of saying that there are a lot of Midwestern Catholics and Lutherans who don’t go to church.)

Huh. Had more to say about that than I thought.

Anyway, Gallup also recently released a poll claiming to show that [religious people are happier than the non-religious, particularly on Sunday](http://www.gallup.com/poll/153374/Churchgoers-Boast-Better-Mood-Especially-Sundays.aspx?ref=image). The first paragraph has a certain you’re-joking-right quality to it:

> Americans who attend a church, synagogue, or mosque frequently report experiencing more positive emotions and fewer negative ones in general than do those who attend less often or not at all. Frequent churchgoers experience an average of 3.36 positive emotions per day compared with an average of 3.08 among those who never attend. This relationship holds true even when controlling for key demographic variables like age, education, and income.

But the averages cover up a much more interesting picture:

It’s almost…aw, crap. It’s not interesting at all, is it?

Perhaps not, but what happens on Sundays *is* a bit interesting. Religious people’s mood increases, which makes sense. The more regularly people attend worship services, the more important that community is to them, so when they get together with the gang at Pastor Tollefson’s church, they get a little lift.* But the non-religious folks’ mood *decreases*. Are they just lonely after all the fun on Saturday? Do they dread the idea of going back to work on Monday? Is the New York Times crossword puzzle really that hard?

*In some churches, of course, they go after one another with hammer and tongs. They probably still get a lift, in that some people just aren’t happy unless they’re complaining about *something*.
