A few folks from our church spent some time setting up an “Easter Garden” in the sanctuary. Carol bought and arranged flowers, Jen helped, Farmer Jim went to get rocks from along his fence line, another Jim and Joe helped him rearrange the furniture.

Me? I put some candles in and gave positive feedback. I know when to stay out of the way.

It isn’t quite done – we have to bring some other flowers in the morning – but I already I love how it looks. I *love* it. I’m hoping some of it will stay this way permanently.

Oh – Pee Ess – if you look carefully, you can see we took the pulpit and sound cabinet out too. We also took the presider’s chairs out from the back of the chancel and put some palms in. Yes, folks, the people who run the worship services are being replaced by potted plants.
